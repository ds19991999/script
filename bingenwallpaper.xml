It's part of the pleasant Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, home to a spectacular and varied landscape of rugged cliffs, golden beaches, wooded estuaries and vast hills. Many visitors are drawn by the world-famous Pembrokeshire Coast Path, which hugs the coastline for 186 miles (299 km), mostly at cliff-top level, passing 58 beaches and 14 harbours along the way. Spring is the perfect time to stretch your legs, as the path is lined with a carpet of colourful wildflowers in full bloom and migrating birds return to the coast. It takes around 12 days to walk the whole length of the path, and its 35,000 feet (11,000 m) of ascent and descent is said to be the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2019 20:05:30 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
