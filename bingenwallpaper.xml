Tucked into a remote region of Nepal, it’s geographically part of the Tibetan Plateau. The area is surrounded by the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri mountains and marked with deep gorges, terraced fields, and colorfully stratified rock formations. But perhaps most fascinating of all are the sky caves, 10,000 or so caves dug into the sides of valleys in several areas of the district. Some of these manmade caves are thought to be ancient burial chambers, others are richly decorated with valuable Buddhist paintings, sculptures, and artifacts from 8th to the 14th century. Perched 150 feet over the valleys, the questions of how they were built, what they were all for, or even how people accessed them remain a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 10:41:22 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
