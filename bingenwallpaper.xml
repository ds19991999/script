April 30 is designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as International Jazz Day to highlight the music and its role in cultures around the world. This year, the day will be celebrated in more than 190 countries with educational programs, community events, and performances—including an all-star concert in Australia at the Melbourne Arts Centre’s Hamer Hall. Musician Herbie Hancock, who serves as a UNESCO Ambassador for Intercultural Dialogue and was instrumental in starting Jazz Day, will serve as co-artistic director of the show, along with trumpeter James Morrison. You can stream the concert on YouTube and Facebook—or celebrate Jazz Day by looking for a local jazz event in your area.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 16:11:09 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
