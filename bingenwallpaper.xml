The event takes place this week in National Harbour, Maryland, as savvy spellers from grade schools and middle schools around the world compete for top honors. If last year’s competition is any indication, it should be dramatic stuff. In 2018, more than 500 students qualified for the 2018 Scripps Spelling Bee after advancing in more local competitions. But it was 14-year-old Karthik Nemmani, a middle school student from McKinney, Texas, who took home the crown when he correctly spelled the word ‘koinonia.’ Another Texan, a 12-year-old girl, placed second after she stumbled over the word ‘bewusstseinslage.’ Frankly, we’re quite certain we’d stumble over that word, too. We suspect the future is bright for both competitors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2019 04:11:11 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
