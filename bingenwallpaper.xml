Located near Seward, Alaska, the park is home to 38 glaciers which cover over half of the area in ice—though climate change has reduced that drastically over the last decades. We're here to celebrate the beginning of National Park Week, a nine-day celebration of the 61 national parks in the US. Parks around the country will be holding special programs and events throughout the week, and today, April 20, is free admission day. So, put on your hiking shoes and start exploring our national treasures.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 16:11:20 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
