Rumours of his likely arrest were pure supposition, he insisted: “I can tell you that I was not born to steal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when police officers went to his home in Lima the next morning to detain him, Mr García asked to make a phone call, went into a room and closed the door, according to the interior minister, Carlos Morán. Minutes later, a shot rang out, and police found Mr García sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head. He died a few hours later in a hospital. Mr García perished as he had lived as a politician—surrounded by controversy.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;He was one of several senior figures caught up in a corruption case that is convulsing Peruvian political life; two other presidents are either in detention or have served time in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The scandal stems from the Lava Jato (“Car Wash”) investigation in Brazil, which has spread to other countries. Brazilian prosecutors have won convictions for 155 people, and prison sentences totalling more than 2,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One major part of the investigation concerns Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company, which has been found to have paid billions of dollars in bribes to politicians across Latin America in exchange for lucrative contracts. In Peru more than a dozen politicians, including Mr García, have been implicated since 2016. Last November, prosecutors barred him from leaving the country for 18 months while he was investigated in several Odebrecht-linked cases, particularly allegations of taking bribes in 2008 in connection with the construction of the metro in Lima. He sought asylum in the Uruguayan embassy in Lima, which was denied. In April, details of corruption involving his confidants started to leak; senior Odebrecht officials were set to testify next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García’s first term in office, from 1985 to 1990, was marked by disastrous populist policies. In 1989, inflation rocketed above 7,000% and economic output shrank by 12%. But his second term, from 2006 to 2011, went much better. A free-trade agreement with the United States set the stage for subsequent deals with China, the European Union and a number of other countries. Average economic growth was impressive, at about 7% per year, and inflation and unemployment remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Although he oversaw strong economic growth, Mr García’s terms were marked by allegations of graft. Two years after the first ended in 1990 he went into exile in Colombia, living between there and France for eight years to avoid prosecution. He returned to make a remarkable political comeback after the statute of limitations had run out in 2001, and won an election in 2006. After his second term ended in 2011, he was again investigated, only to be let off the hook on technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Lava Jato investigation was too extensive to escape, however. It has exposed the corruption and incompetence at the heart of Peruvian politics. Prosecutors have asked the United States to extradite Alejandro Toledo, Mr García’s predecessor, who stands accused of accepting a $20m bribe from Odebrecht (he denies the allegation). Both of Mr García’s successors are also implicated: Ollanta Humala spent nearly nine months in prison. He was released a year ago this month, pending trial for allegedly receiving $3m in undeclared campaign funds from the construction giant. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was detained on April 10th on similar charges, but was then taken to hospital suffering from high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Odebrecht net has also ensnared Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the conservative Popular Force party and daughter of a former president, Alberto Fujimori. Both are sitting in prison. She is there for allegedly accepting a $1m campaign contribution from Odebrecht. Her father was convicted of violating human rights during his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García may have ended his torment. But the consequences of the Odebrecht scandal will be felt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 02:06:20 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Attempts to improve public health in Bangladesh appear to have misfired]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/18/attempts-to-improve-public-health-in-bangladesh-appear-to-have-misfired]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_WOC277.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GIVEN A CHOICE between using a nearby water well known to be contaminated with arsenic or a more distant one not known to be poisoned, every sane person would opt for the latter. In Bangladesh in the early 2000s, however, that appears to have been the wrong decision. In 1994 the government began a massive campaign to convince households drawing water from shallow backyard wells with high concentrations of arsenic to switch to deeper wells or streams that were free of the toxic metal. Arsenic is present naturally in groundwater across the globe, but is especially prevalent in Bangladesh. In 1999, roughly 65% of Bangladeshis were drinking water with unsafe levels of arsenic, which could lead to increased rates of cancer and infant mortality as well as decreased intelligence quotient for affected children. However, alternative sources were typically farther away from people’s homes, increasing the likelihood that users would make fewer trips and store their water for longer periods of time. And improperly stored water is often mishandled, increasing the rates of cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases. As a result, by asking people not to use wells polluted with arsenic, the government unintentionally caused the number of deaths resulting from ingesting water contaminated by faecal matter to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Nina Buchmann, an economist at Stanford, and her co-authors collected data from 3,138 Bangladeshi households between 2007 and 2009. Their data included a sample of more than 12,000 children born between 1980 and 2007, which allowed them to evaluate the mortality rate among households that did and did not switch water sources during the government’s campaign. According to their study, by 2004 Bangladeshis who switched to getting their water from far-away wells had a mortality rate four times as high as that of families who still drew from a shallow backyard well. They found that the increase in deaths was higher in households that were farther away from a deep well, which increases the storage time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Bangladesh has one of the gravest arsenic-poisoning problems in the world, foreign public-health experts have generally praised the government’s efforts to curb the use of backyard wells. In just eight years, the group of governmental and non-governmental organisations spread awareness of contamination to the majority of the country’s households. But the evidence that the push has actually had a negative net effect on people’s health highlights the risk that even well-thought-out public policy often has unintended consequences. The biggest barrier to clean water in Bangladesh now might be education about proper handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 01:08:12 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jet Airways stops all operations]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2019/04/18/jet-airways-stops-all-operations]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_blp907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T11:06:20Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;IT HAS BEEN a slow, painful, descent. For months, Jet Airways, once India’s second largest airline, has been failing. Planes were grounded for non-payment of leases, fuel deliveries stopped, flights inevitably cancelled, frustrated customers denied access to lounges and subject to unending frustrations. Unpaid pilots loudly threatened to strike and quietly disembarked to work for competitors. Non-stop meetings were held by investors and lenders to concoct a rescue plan, but little progress towards one was made. When an announcement finally came on April 18th that all flights had been suspended, it was hardly a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The final blow was the unwillingness of a consortium of banks to release emergency funding. They had been burned during collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012 in similar circumstances. And they had no faith that the outcome would be any different this time around. There had been some moments of optimism, most strikingly in March when the airline’s founder and controlling shareholder Naresh Goyal voluntarily agreed to surrender control. That had sparked hope that Etihad Airways, which held a 24% stake, would step forward. And it was widely believed that in the final states of a national election campaign, the administration of Narendra Modi would not allow Jet to collapse. Quiet steps would be taken to push state-controlled banks to do whatever was required to keep it afloat.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But a lack of confidence in the airline’s management proved overwhelming. The government did not intervene to save the airline. And Etihad, burned by the bankruptcy of Air Berlin and Alitalia in 2017, two other airlines in which it had stakes, was loathe to throw more good money after bad. The announcement that all operations were grounded came through a notice filed to the Bombay Stock Exchange saying that a consortium of lenders led by the country’s largest financial institution, the State Bank of India, had denied the company’s request for more money. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What happens next, particularly to the 16,500 or so workers it directly employs is unclear. A sale process is under way, with hopes that it will be completed by the end of May. But whether there is anything left to be sold depends on what, by then, are the company’s assets. Its planes were largely acquired through leases that have been voided because of non-payment. Many of its best employees will have left for other companies. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;That leaves what has been its most valuable asset since it was founded in 1993: the landing and take-off slots it has accumulated at airports in Mumbai and Delhi. But these apparently come with conditions of usage that are likely to have been violated by the suspension of flights. Whether the landing rights are retained by the administrators or are reallocated for free to other carriers–as competitors hope–will play a large role in what now unfolds along with a second issue that has so far received little attention. Air India, the country’s state-owned flag carrier, is in deep financial trouble as well. A restructuring has been tried and delayed because of the political sensitivities involved and the clout of its trade unions. But as with Jet, its problems cannot be ignored indefinitely. Many believe the time for such a large undertaking to occur will be after the next election–which will be concluded as early as next month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 23:06:50 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mauricio Macri freezes prices]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/18/mauricio-macri-freezes-prices]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_blp905.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAURICIO MACRI&amp;#x27;S original plan was to address Argentina’s citizens on television on the final working day before the Easter break. But he opted for a folksier way of presenting an economic package that he hopes will rescue his chances of being re-elected president in October. He appeared in a taped video, knocking on the door of a house belonging to a young working-class couple, then sitting down with them to explain his plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We’ve done everything to try to fix the long-term in our country, and we’re going to win the battle,” said Mr Macri from the couple’s living-room. “We’re now giving you a respite, some relief for the months ahead.” He left it to his ministers to fill in the details at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are a change of course for a president who sought to undo the effects of more than a decade of populist government. The most important one is a revival of a price-control mechanism in force under the two Peronist presidents who preceded him, Néstor Kirchner and his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. In Mr Macri’s version, which he, like the Kirchners, calls “precios cuidados” (“curated prices”), the price of 64 consumer items, from milk to jam, will be frozen for six months (ie, until the eve of the election). An “army” of inspectors, under the direction of the production ministry, will enforce supermarkets’ adherence to the freeze. The government also said it would not go ahead with planned price rises this year in electricity, gas and public transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another move to contain inflation, the central bank said it would not allow the peso to weaken as much as it had planned. Starting this week it will spend up to $60m a day to support the currency. The money comes from the IMF, which has agreed to lend Argentina $57bn to support economic reforms. The government has also opened new credit lines for pensioners and families with children and expanded a plan to build new homes with state financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are desperate responses to a bleak economic situation. Prices in March were 54.7% higher than during the same month a year before. Food and drink prices rose 64% in the past 12 months. The price of mincemeat in Buenos Aires rose by a staggering 134%. The IMF expects inflation this year to be 43.7%, but some economists fear it will top 50%. The high interest rates needed to contain inflation have caused a recession. GDP, which contracted by 2.5% last year, is expected to shrink by a further 1.2% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Mr Macri has been a pro-business president, his government largely blames business for these woes. A government minister lambasted supermarkets for raising prices by up to 15% in the 48 hours before the price freezes were announced. “April, perhaps, is already lost to this inflation spiral,” he said. “If we don’t see evidence of inflation coming down in May, we will be fried.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually businesses do not raise prices out of spite. High inflation is difficult to stop once it has started because higher prices encourage demands for higher wages, which in turn force force producers to push up prices. A trigger in Argentina was a sharp decline in the value of the peso. In March the IMF warned that “breaking inflation inertia will be a lengthy process”, which will depend largely on the central bank’s control of growth in the money supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Macri government’s new tactic is unlikely to defeat inflation. Price controls on selected supermarket products imposed by the Kirchners from 2007 to 2015 had a temporary effect on overall inflation and did not tame growth in the prices of other products, according to a study by Diego Aparicio of MIT and Alberto Cavallo of Harvard University. Although the economists did not find evidence of shortages of price-controlled goods, supermarkets were able to dodge some price controls by introducing new varieties at higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF welcomed the central bank’s change to the trading range of the peso. But it is likely to take a dimmer view of the price controls. Delayed price increases for public services risk widening the budget deficit beyond the limit set by the IMF.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;But it is Argentine voters, not the IMF, whose approbation Mr Macri needs now. The latest polls suggest that he could lose to Ms Fernández, even though she has been indicted on several counts of corruption. Senior figures in his Cambiemos (Let’s Change) alliance are considering nominating someone to challenge him for the nomination to be the grouping’s presidential candidate in primaries scheduled for August. Mr Macri does not have time for the “persistence and consistency” the IMF recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 21:50:38 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[An intriguing new adaptation of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters”]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/04/18/an-intriguing-new-adaptation-of-chekhovs-three-sisters]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_BKP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T10:37:55Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE third act of “Three Sisters” Ivan Chebutykin, a bumbling old doctor, drunkenly knocks over a clock, smashing it to bits. In Anton Chekhov’s plays no prop is without symbolic weight, and the broken clock is a particularly rich (if unsubtle) symbol: a rupture with times past. In a new adaptation at the Almeida theatre in London, the broken clock also signifies a different kind of anachronism. Here, the &lt;em&gt;fin-de-siècle&lt;/em&gt; listlessness of Chekhov’s play is partially relocated to the present. The characters speak in a contemporary vernacular, but they exchange traditional Russian silverware and dream of a future in which “women will wear trousers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim, presumably, is to emphasise the connections between Chekhov’s time and the 21st century, and the play does have much to say to angst-ridden millennials. The young protagonists are struggling to carve out a personal and political role for themselves. They are talked down to by an older generation that dismisses their concerns as unserious and narcissistic (as Cordelia Lynn, who has written the adaptation, said in an interview: “What does that remind you of?”) Chekhov’s plot centres on the attempts of the titular siblings to work, marry or adulterate their way out of a rural backwater, where they moved from their longed-for Moscow home. When a military garrison arrives in town, bringing with it the glamorous Lieutenant-Colonel Vershinin (Peter McDonald) and Baron Tuzenbach (Shubham Saraf), the sisters see an escape route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearl Chanda, Patsy Ferran and Ria Zmitrowicz give accomplished performances as Masha, Olga and Irina Sergeyevna respectively. As the girls’ lives wear on, their ambitions are thwarted. Masha’s acid tongue and intellectual conviction give way to melancholy and malaise, even as she pursues a love affair with Vershinin. Irina’s enthusiasm for work is ground down by the mundane reality of jobs in the telegraph office and local council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odd sibling out is brother Andrey, played with despondency by Freddie Meredith. Unlike his sisters, he marries for love, to local girl Natasha Ivanovna (Lois Chimimba). But he, too, ends up desperately unhappy, abandoning his dreams of academia as his gambling addiction, his children and his unfaithful wife consume his life. As Olga, Ms Ferran has the slighter part, perhaps surprisingly given her award-winning turn in Ms Frecknall’s last Almeida production, Tennesee Williams’s “Summer and Smoke”. In that play, every scene ratchets up the tension like a coiled spring. The Chekhov is an altogether different affair: images and plotlines spark in different directions, before darkening to ash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The play works best when the pace is quick. In the first act, before the confessional speechifying gets properly underway, each scene moves energetically into the next, with most of the cast onstage. The third act injects another shot of energy, when a fire breaks out in the village. For the most part, however, the play is unavoidably cumbersome. Even as the production plays up the Beckettian verbosity, some absurdity remains. At the interval, one Almeida dramaturge commented that, had the text arrived on his desk from a new writer, he would have reached quickly for the red pen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is a thought-provoking interpretation of the material. In the production’s boldest anachronism, Chebutykin quotes T.S Eliot’s “Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock”. The poem was written 15 years after Chekhov’s death, but it is a startling prism through which to view “Three Sisters”, itself a linguistic and structural patchwork. The characters miserably measure out their lives, in coffee spoons, shot glasses or baby bottles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the great risk of staging a play about crushing ennui and profound dissatisfaction is the possibility of instilling those feelings in the audience. Despite the three-hour running time, a consistently strong cast helps this production to avoid that pitfall—narrowly. No easy answers are granted to the audience any more than to the characters. The protagonists try to escape, to advance or to return. All end up nightmarishly stuck, like the hands of a broken clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Three Sisters” is at the Almeida until June 1st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:06:27 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, is running for president in Taiwan]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/17/terry-gou-the-founder-of-foxconn-is-running-for-president-in-taiwan]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_ASP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AT A TEMPLE festooned with red lanterns, Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, declared that Mazu, the sea goddess, had recently appeared to him in a dream. “Mazu told me to come out and do something,” he recounted after lighting some incense. Thus did the tycoon announce that he had decided to run for president. Mazu, he insisted, also urged him to seek peace with China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr Gou’s firm makes iPhones for Apple, among other things. His decision to seek the nomination of the Kuomintang party (KMT), Taiwan’s main opposition party, for the presidential election in January, has caused a sensation on the island-state. His wealth and fame instantly make him a strong contender. But his close ties to China will alarm many, since China considers Taiwan part of its territory, and is always looking for ways to undermine Taiwan’s government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent president, already confronted an uphill battle in her campaign for re-election. Her approval ratings are low. She faces a challenger for the nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the form of her former prime minister, Lai Ching-te. Mr Lai is more popular than Ms Tsai, which is especially troubling for the president since the DPP will pick as its nominee the candidate who performs best in a national opinion poll to be conducted in late May or early June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr Gou has a good chance to secure the nomination of the KMT, which will pick a candidate based largely on an opinion poll, like the DPP, but also with some input from a vote of the party’s members. The two other declared candidates, Eric Chu, a former mayor of New Taipei City, and Wang Jin-pyng, a former speaker of parliament, are not as famous as Mr Gou. The more formidable Han Kuo-yu, the mayor of Taiwan’s second-biggest city, Kaohsiung, may yet throw his hat in the ring—although he may also be put off by Mr Gou’s unexpected candidacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Either way, Mr Gou will doubtless try to sell himself as an ordinary Taiwanese made good—hence his folksy visit to the temple in the gritty suburbs of Taipei. He founded Foxconn with a small loan, and built it into the world’s biggest contract manufacturer for big electronics brands. Given that voters are concerned above all with the weakness of the Taiwanese economy, his business acumen will be a big selling point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But in another sense, Mr Gou’s business empire will be a liability. Most of Foxconn’s factories are in China. That gives the Chinese government huge leverage over him. It is hard to see how Mr Gou can escape from the glaring conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lots of Taiwanese own businesses in China, and around 1m of them work there, out of a total population of 24m. The KMT favours warmer ties with China, and still upholds the idea that the two countries will one day be reunified. The DPP, in contrast, considers Taiwan a completely distinct country, and would like the world to treat it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Since the DPP won both the presidency and a majority in parliament in 2016, China has called a halt to all high-level contacts between the two countries and choked off the flow of Chinese package tourists to Taiwan. It has also tried to win over the few countries that still have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and regularly deploys warships and fighter jets dangerously close to the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr Gou could probably put a stop to this intimidation with a more emollient approach were he to become president. But many Taiwanese would inevitably be asking themselves what the hidden costs might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:06:26 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alan García, Peru’s ex-president, kills himself before being arrested]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/17/alan-garcia-perus-ex-president-kills-himself-before-being-arrested]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_AMP502_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ON THE evening of April 16th, Alan García, Peru’s former president, went on the radio to declare he was innocent of accusations of corruption that were swirling around. Rumours of his likely arrest were pure supposition, he insisted: “I can tell you that I was not born to steal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when police officers went to his home in Lima the next morning to detain him, Mr García asked to make a phone call, went into a room and closed the door, according to the interior minister, Carlos Morán. Minutes later, a shot rang out, and police found Mr García sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head. He died a few hours later in a hospital. Mr García perished as he had lived as a politician—surrounded by controversy.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;He was one of several senior figures caught up in a corruption case that is convulsing Peruvian political life; two other presidents are either in detention or have served time in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The scandal stems from the Lava Jato (“Car Wash”) investigation in Brazil, which has spread to other countries. Brazilian prosecutors have won convictions for 155 people, and prison sentences totalling more than 2,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One major part of the investigation concerns Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company, which has been found to have paid billions of dollars in bribes to politicians across Latin America in exchange for lucrative contracts. In Peru more than a dozen politicians, including Mr García, have been implicated since 2016. Last November, prosecutors barred him from leaving the country for 18 months while he was investigated in several Odebrecht-linked cases, particularly allegations of taking bribes in 2008 in connection with the construction of the metro in Lima. He sought asylum in the Uruguayan embassy in Lima, which was denied. In April, details of corruption involving his confidants started to leak; senior Odebrecht officials were set to testify next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García’s first term in office, from 1985 to 1990, was marked by disastrous populist policies. In 1989, inflation rocketed above 7,000% and economic output shrank by 12%. But his second term, from 2006 to 2011, went much better. A free-trade agreement with the United States set the stage for subsequent deals with China, the European Union and a number of other countries. Average economic growth was impressive, at about 7% per year, and inflation and unemployment remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Although he oversaw strong economic growth, Mr García’s terms were marked by allegations of graft. Two years after the first ended in 1990 he went into exile in Colombia, living between there and France for eight years to avoid prosecution. He returned to make a remarkable political comeback after the statute of limitations had run out in 2001, and won an election in 2006. After his second term ended in 2011, he was again investigated, only to be let off the hook on technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Lava Jato investigation was too extensive to escape, however. It has exposed the corruption and incompetence at the heart of Peruvian politics. Prosecutors have asked the United States to extradite Alejandro Toledo, Mr García’s predecessor, who stands accused of accepting a $20m bribe from Odebrecht (he denies the allegation). Both of Mr García’s successors are also implicated: Ollanta Humala spent nearly nine months in prison. He was released a year ago this month, pending trial for allegedly receiving $3m in undeclared campaign funds from the construction giant. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was detained on April 10th on similar charges, but was then taken to hospital suffering from high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Odebrecht net has also ensnared Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the conservative Popular Force party and daughter of a former president, Alberto Fujimori. Both are sitting in prison. She is there for allegedly accepting a $1m campaign contribution from Odebrecht. Her father was convicted of violating human rights during his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García may have ended his torment. But the consequences of the Odebrecht scandal will be felt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 08:08:50 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alberta’s new premier plans to abolish the carbon tax]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/17/albertas-new-premier-plans-to-abolish-the-carbon-tax]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_AMP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HELP IS on the way, and hope is on the horizon,” proclaimed Jason Kenney after his United Conservative Party decisively won the election in Alberta, an oil-producing province in western Canada, on April 16th. He was talking to Albertans depressed by a downturn in the oil industry, which has pushed up unemployment and left empty a quarter of the office space in Calgary, the province’s biggest city. For Justin Trudeau, Canada’s Liberal prime minister, Mr Kenney’s victory is more a source of worry than of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Alberta’s slump was largely caused by factors beyond the province’s control—notably the fall in oil prices in 2014-15—voters took their anger out on the government of Rachel Notley of the left-leaning New Democratic Party. Her election four years ago had been a first for a province with a reputation for Texas-like conservatism and suspicion of the federal authorities in Ottawa. Ms Notley is a defender of the province’s oil industry, which extracts the stuff expensively from tar sands. She lobbied hard for an expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline to take more oil to the Pacific coast for export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she is also an environmentalist, and introduced a carbon tax, now C$30 ($22) a tonne, to discourage greenhouse-gas emissions. In striking this balance she had an ally in Mr Trudeau, who championed the pipeline but also passed a law requiring provinces to set a price on carbon emissions or to submit to one imposed by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Canada has resisted that grand bargain. The province of British Columbia, the pipeline’s terminus, remains opposed to the project on environmental grounds. In August 2018 the federal government took it over from Kinder Morgan, the frustrated US-based firm trying to build it. Moreover, four provinces led by conservative premiers—Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick—are fighting Mr Trudeau’s carbon price in the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta will now join them. Mr Kenney, a former federal immigration minister described by Maclean’s, a magazine, as a “Guinness-sipping nerd”, is expected swiftly to kill the provincial carbon tax. He plans to raise an emissions cap on tar sands oil production and slow down plans to eliminate coal-fired electricity. He has threatened to cut off British Columbia from shipments of Alberta’s oil if it continues to oppose the pipeline expansion. Mr Kenney also promises to bring “tens of thousands of jobs” to Alberta by slashing environmental and labour regulation, and by reducing the corporate-tax rate from 12% to 8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, his victory will pose additional problems for Mr Trudeau, who has been hurt by allegations that his office put improper pressure on the country’s attorney-general to drop the prosecution of a Quebec-based engineering company. He faces a re-election battle in October. But Mr Trudeau may not mind a fight over climate policy. According to a poll conducted in March by Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians say climate change is one of the top five issues they will consider when they vote. Just 28% of Canadians are firmly opposed to a carbon tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government has the power to override British Columbia’s opposition to the pipeline expansion. It could do so as early as May 22nd. That gives Mr Trudeau some hope that he can rescue his energy grand bargain, despite Mr Kenney’s opposition to the carbon tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta’s new premier may benefit from an upturn in the province’s growth. The unemployment rate was 6.9% in March. That is still 1.1 percentage points above the national rate, but it is well below the peak of 9.1% in November 2016. TD Financial Group, a bank, predicts that Alberta’s economy will grow by 2.4% in real terms next year, the fastest rate in the country, thanks in part to a rise in oil prices. The sunnier outlook has nothing to do with the new premier’s pro-oil policies. That will not stop him from taking the credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 04:10:38 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Indonesia’s president wins a second term]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/17/indonesias-president-wins-a-second-term]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_ASP503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE RESULTS was never really in doubt. On April 17th, just hours after polling stations closed, pollsters released preliminary estimates showing that Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo (better known as Jokowi) had won a second term in office. He is thought to have clinched about 55% of the vote, against 45% for his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, a former general. The contest was a replay of the previous race, in 2014, which Jokowi won by a slightly narrower margin. On April 18th the election commission will announce the preliminary result, before an official, certified outcome to be released in May. Its numbers may differ fractionally from those of the pollsters, but the outcome will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters&amp;#x27; enduring support for Jokowi can be partly explained by his sensible policies. Outside a polling station in a village near Jakarta, Suyagina, a housewife, says it is now much easier for her to buy medicines thanks to Jokowi&amp;#x27;s expansion of health-insurance coverage. Rachman, a middle-aged voter sporting enormous sunglasses and a crisp white shirt, says the president’s much-needed investment in infrastructure has helped, too. And Jokowi has managed the economy reasonably well, keeping inflation low and growth solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jokowi&amp;#x27;s likely victory is also thanks to cynical politicking. One weakness of his previous campaign was a perceived lack of piety, which put off some voters. Rumours circulating on social media claimed that he was a closet Christian—a potential handicap in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. This time Jokowi shielded himself from such accusations by picking a hardline Muslim cleric, Ma&amp;#x27;ruf Amin, as his running-mate. The vice-president-elect wants the country to adopt Islamic law and is keen to ban homosexual acts as well as some Muslim sects he considers heretical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jokowi has also cosied up to the army to counter Mr Prabowo’s nationalism. He has peppered his inner circle with retired generals and is considering reserving some jobs in the civil service jobs for soldiers. In the fashion of Indonesia’s former strongmen, he has used the police, prosecutors and bureaucrats to make life difficult for his most vocal opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite Jokowi’s use of such underhand tactics, his victory still looks likely to be smaller than expected. He was hoping to claim over 60% of the vote—the tally with which his predecessor was re-elected. Opinion polls before the election had given him a 20-percentage-point lead. Experts put the disappointing showing partly down to Mr Prabowo&amp;#x27;s strong electoral machine, which helped to turn out wavering supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Mr Prabowo will respond to another defeat is unclear. In 2014 he cried foul and challenged the result in the constitutional court. He also encouraged his supporters to take to the streets. That could happen again. He has already claimed that his own party&amp;#x27;s tally shows him to be the true victor, a finding which is entirely at odds with that of most pollsters. At a press conference outside his house in Jakarta he told supporters to guard ballot boxes, implying that the other side had cheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Mr Prabowo’s supporters do protest against the result, that would blight a well-run election. Coordinating balloting for 187m registered voters across a rugged and sprawling archipelago of 17,000 islands is no small feat. Yet voting mostly went smoothly and participants seemed glad of the chance to take part. The biggest source of disruption was confusion over the long list of candidates. Voters were not only picking a president, but a national legislature and provincial, local and municipal assemblies too. That meant many voters had to wrestle with five different ballot papers, some of which were the size of a poster, with hundreds of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of races other than the presidential one are still trickling in. It looks as though the make-up of the national parliament will remain much the same. The victors of local battles could take some time to be declared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data also suggest that turnout has jumped by about five percentage points since the 2014 election, to around 80%. That would make it the biggest election ever conducted in a single day, anywhere. That is probably thanks to a concerted campaign to turn out the vote by politicians on both sides. Businesses joined in the effort. Hundreds of them, from cinemas to sushi restaurants, offered discounts to those who had voted and could prove it with an ink-stained finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high turnout may be one of the few things about the election that pleases Jokowi. Both he and his party, PDI-P, fared worse than expected. A heftier victory would have allowed him to sideline his conservative vice-president and the armed forces. And had PDI-P claimed more seats it would have been able to reduce its reliance on its five coalition partners. Jokowi has made compromises to ensure re-election, but failed to consolidate his power as a result. Those compromises may haunt him in his second term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 04:10:37 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI powers Amazon]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/17/how-ai-powers-amazon]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/babbage_9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T19:02:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMAZON’S USE of artificial intelligence has long outstripped Facebook’s and Google’s.
