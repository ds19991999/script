A bitter political battle between the president, Maithripala Sirisena, and the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, had so crippled the government that it lacked the information to prevent the catastrophe, blamed on a little-known jihadist group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victims were mainly Christians who perished while attending Easter services in three churches in Colombo, nearby Negombo and Batticaloa on the east coast. At least 36 foreigners were among the dead in three other explosions at five-star hotels in Colombo. More than 500 people were injured in the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are very, very sorry as a government,” Rajitha Senaratne, its spokesman, said, before repeatedly claiming that Mr Sirisena had failed to give reports of a possible attack to Mr Wickremesinghe. Had he done so, it was implied, the carnage could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that national intelligence agencies had issued their warnings as early as April 4th. In a letter on April 9th the chief of national intelligence had even named suspects—a level of detail that is very rare for such warnings. And shortly before the attacks, the spy agencies’ foreign counterparts had again alerted Sri Lankan authorities that places of religious worship, especially of Catholics, and areas with high concentrations of tourists “may be targeted”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the local head of the Catholic church, said he would have cancelled all Easter masses had this crucial information been shared. The failure to communicate “makes us hold our heads in our hands”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was revealed that Mr Wickremesinghe has not even been invited to meetings of the national security council, which are chaired by the president, since October last year. That was when Mr Sirisena abruptly sacked the prime minister and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa, his predecessor as president, before dissolving parliament. But in December Mr Sirisena was humiliatingly forced to reinstate Mr Wickremesinghe as prime minister, after courts ruled the dissolution unconstitutional and illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large scale and co-ordinated nature of the bombings—with 87 more bomb detonators discovered at Colombo’s main bus station on Monday—point to a high degree of planning and considerable sophistication. The attacks are the first on such a scale since the end of the bloody 27-year civil war with the Tamil Tigers ten years ago, and the deadliest co-ordinated acts of terrorism Sri Lanka has ever suffered. They are the first directed at Sri Lanka’s Christian minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Senaratne blamed a local jihadist group called the National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) and said the suicide-bombers were Sri Lankan. But he also said the strikes could not have succeeded without an international network. Shiral Lakthilake, a spokesman for the president, separately told journalists that the “involvement of international elements is clear”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTJ is reported to have formed as a splinter of the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath (SLTJ) an ultra-conservative Islamist movement with ties to like-minded groups in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, a short distance across the sea. Radical Islamist networks, some fuelled by the rise of Islamic State, have also sprouted up in the broader region, from the Maldives to Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the carnage more than 1,000 police and soldiers were deployed for security in Colombo alone. A state of emergency covering the whole country is to go into effect at midnight on April 22nd. Mr Sirisena also appointed a three-member panel to investigate the “causes and circumstances of the tragedy” and declared April 23rd a day of national mourning. On Twitter Asanga Welikala, a law lecturer, described this gesture as “absolute rubbish tokenism”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also dismay at the way debate soon descended to political infighting. The attacks, however, have spurred an open discussion about the growth of jihadism in Sri Lanka. The conversation has been muted because of fears of stoking anti-Muslim sentiment. Extremist Buddhists from the Sinhala majority have on occasion attacked Muslims on various pretexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Muslim leaders have started speaking up. Rauff Hakeem, leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, a political party, said that Muslims and their leaders “have to engage in introspection regarding what is happening within the community”. He also said that community had been trying for a very long time, including through its mosques, to tackle the spread of extremism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 05:20:53 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[After terrorists kill nearly 300 people in Sri Lanka a blame game begins]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/22/after-terrorists-kill-nearly-300-people-in-sri-lanka-a-blame-game-begins]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/000_1fu2lg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-22T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 22nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE AFTERMATH of a co-ordinated series of terrorist suicide-bombings in churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday that left nearly 300 people dead, attention has begun to focus on the goverment’s failure to act on warnings that such an attack was imminent.

Pope Francis (pictured) duly chided rich countries over the arms race, called for peace in the greater Middle East and Africa, and lamented the victims of terror in Sri Lanka. The power of such occasions depends both on modern technology and on a centuries-old tradition, which holds that the task of representing Jesus Christ as his “vicar” on earth falls to a single, uniquely legitimate office-holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;But in the grounds of the Vatican, there are two gentlemen who use the title of pope: Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who lives nearby in a comfortable former convent. Officially, they get along well. On April 15th the current pontiff called on Benedict to offer congratulations on the eve of his 92nd birthday. But in photographs, Francis looked less genial than usual, and some wondered whether the wishes had been delivered through gritted teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;For several years, it has been clear that the relatively liberal, relatively inclusive style that Francis brings to the papacy is triggering a wave of theological and political opposition in many Catholic quarters. And some of that opposition is crystallising around Benedict, who styles himself “pope emeritus” and has retained some of the trappings of his old office, including the all-white garb plus a papal ring and dangling cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;What is not so clear is how far Benedict himself, and/or people with strong influence over him, are encouraging people to think of him as a counter-weight to Francis. But Massimo Faggioli, an Italian theologian, has likened the present situation to a “post-modern version” of a medieval schism: between 1378 and 1417, two and sometimes three clerics vied for the title of pope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Recent events have brought the contrast between the two clerics to a head. Benedict’s newly-published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/04/12/a-former-pope-blames-the-swinging-sixties-for-clerical-crimes&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the surging sex-abuse crisis on the swinging sixties and “homosexual cliques” in seminaries, was his most blatant intervention since stepping down in 2013. Francis showed a very different style when, in a TV show aired on April 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, he assured a gay British comedian that “only people who don’t have a heart” would fail to respect him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;For Vatican-watchers, all this simply marks one more episode in a long-term build-up of tension between the two popes, egged on by conservative critics of Francis. It was three years ago that Matteo Salvini, the anti-immigrant politician who is now Italian interior minister, sported a T-shirt with a pun in capital letters. “IL MIO PAPA E BENEDETTO” could either mean “my pope is Benedict” or “my pope is blessed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;On the ecclesiastical front, four conservative cardinals (of whom America’s Cardinal Raymond Burke was the best-known) showed their hand in November 2016 with a letter that challenged a Vatican document which had promised more generous treatment to Catholics who divorce and remarry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;A few months later, the Benedict camp seemed to offer moral support to that challenge. At the funeral of one of the four signatories, a German prelate who is one of Benedict’s close&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;aides, Georg Gänswein, read a letter from the ex-pontiff, saying pointedly that God would not abandon the church “even if the boat [is] on the verge of capsizing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Whereas traditionalist clerics take issue with Francis over reproduction and sexuality, worldly politicians find fault with him (and see merit in his predecessor) over questions like immigration and the protection of traditional Western culture. European conservatives loved Benedict for his perceived attachment to the heritage of their continent; their American counterparts resent Francis for his anti-capitalism and his embrace of the grievances of the global South. All these impulses have come together in the increasing prominence of a right-wing Catholic think-tank located not far from Rome, the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, with which Cardinal Burke and Steve Bannon, a former adviser of President Donald Trump, are deeply involved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;In the world of Catholic theology, as opposed to its political exploitation, there are those who insist that the Francis-Benedict rift is either exaggerated or being mischievously fanned by people who have little real concern for either cleric. Indeed, even among theologically-minded fans of Francis, some still profess admiration for Benedict “at his best” as a clear thinker and teacher. Michael Sean Winters, a Catholic writer, responded to the 6,000-word essay by calling it a mixture of flawed analysis and trivial anecdote which nonetheless contained glimmers of the “genius and beauty” which characterised the work of Benedict (formerly Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) at its finest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;And to right-wing Americans who loathe Francis’s aversion to capitalism and embrace of the environment, it can be pointed out that both Benedict and his predecessor John Paul II had some harsh things to say about the unrestrained market. Nor has any recent pope been a fan of America’s military policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;On the other hand, Benedict has hardly made life easy for his successor.&lt;span &gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After his surprise retirement in March 2013, he vowed to “remain hidden to the world”. He could have retired to a monastery in his native Bavaria and never said another public word. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead, he gave himself scope for future interventions. He not only kept many of the paraphernalia of office but, so critics argue, seemed keen to retain its essence. Many canon lawyers say his chosen title of “pope emeritus” is a dubiously-founded provocation, and that it would have been more correct to call himself bishop emeritus of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Others note that Benedict’s resignation speech, in Latin, was profoundly and perhaps deliberately ambiguous. He said that, because of his age, he no longer had strength to exercise the papal ministry (munus in Latin). But he then went on to say that the munus had aspects: one consisted of acting and speaking and the other of praying and suffering. Father Stefano Violi, a canon-law teacher, reckons that Benedict was merely surrendering the administrative duties of a pope but not the pastoral ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;For conservatives who want to present themselves as anti-Francis but loyal (perhaps more loyal than the pontiff himself) to the Catholic tradition, Benedict’s presence in the Vatican city is, at a minimum, a golden opportunity.&lt;span &gt; And Benedict seems unable to resist the temptation of offering that opportunity.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 00:06:23 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[American millennials think they will be rich]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/22/american-millennials-think-they-will-be-rich]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/20190427_woc760.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-22T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 22nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE THAN half of American millennials, the generation of people born between 1981 and 1996, believe that they will one day be millionaires; one in five think they will get there by the age of 40. These are the findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://s1.q4cdn.com/959385532/files/doc_downloads/research/2018/Millennials-and-Money-survey.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2018 by TD Ameritrade, a financial-services company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Will-Retirement-Saving-Change-by-2050.docx.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;working paper&lt;/a&gt; by the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, offers a sobering antidote to this youthful optimism. It finds that millennials are less wealthy than people of a similar age were in any year from 1989 to 2007. The economic crisis of 2008-09 hit millennials particularly hard. Median household wealth in 2016 for 20- to 35-year-olds was about 25% lower than it was for the similar-aged cohort in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American millennials are comparatively poor because many of them came of age during the financial crisis, when demand for labour was low and borrowing money became harder. The recovery has been slow, which has further reduced millennials’ long-term earning potential. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018080pap.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by the Federal Reserve, published last year, found that millennial household incomes were 11% lower than they were for people in Generation X (those born between the mid-1960s and 1981) at a comparable age; they were 14% lower than for baby boomers at the same point in their lives. A growing number of young people have taken on debt to finance their studies. And because real wages have not kept up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt;, the cost of living has risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_WOC757.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190427_WOC757.png 200w,

Millennials do more freelance and part-time work than other generations did, which makes it more difficult to obtain an employer-provided pension. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nirsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Millennials-Report-1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Only 55%&lt;/a&gt; of this generation have access to retirement plans, compared with 77% of Generation X and 80% of baby-boomers. Moreover, those who do have employer pensions are more likely to have defined-contribution pensions than defined-benefit ones, meaning that they bear the risk if investment returns disappoint. And as America seeks to plug its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/02/08/americas-extraordinary-economic-gamble&quot;&gt;long-term fiscal shortfalls&lt;/a&gt;, millennials will have to bear the burden of any future cuts to Social Security and Medicare. All of this helps to explain why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/05/its-becoming-more-common-for-young-adults-to-live-at-home-and-for-longer-stretches/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; of people aged 25 to 34 who are living with their parents has increased from 10% in 2000 to about 15% today. That is not quite the high life millennials imagined.&lt;p&gt;But all is not lost. Millennials are living longer and are the best-educated generation in history. Taken together, this could yet mean that the youngest millennials, who have been less scarred by the crisis, could contribute towards their retirement pots for longer. Then there is mum and dad: even if they don’t become millionaires, millennials will one day inherit from their parents, and that may help redress their relative poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 22:07:27 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Airlines may be underestimating the cost of the 737 MAX groundings]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2019/04/18/airlines-may-be-underestimating-the-cost-of-the-737-max-groundings]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/000_1f706b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T10:58:39Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;IN MARCH REGULATORS around the world grounded all Boeing 737 MAX jets after two of the type crashed within five months of each other, killing 346 people. Soon afterwards Ryanair, the carrier in Europe that has placed the most orders for the new jet, insisted that the move would have little impact on its network. That was either wishful thinking or misinformation. Just three weeks later, the number of flights it had scheduled from London to Edinburgh, Britain’s busiest domestic route, fell 85%. Frequencies from London to Belfast plummeted 91%. If flights had to be axed, those ones made the most sense. Margins are tight on these routes due to high domestic aviation taxes in Britain and stiff competition from other airlines and rail firms. But the move highlights the growing toll that the MAX’s grounding is having on airlines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Across the Atlantic, 275 flights per day are now being cancelled by American and Southwest, the two airlines that operate the most MAXs in America. Both carriers hope to resume normal service in August, by which time Boeing hopes to have fixed the software bug that is suspected to have caused the two crashes. But the timeline is mere guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Even if accurate, it could take Boeing much longer to get the fix approved by regulators in other countries. In previous years, the quality of the regulatory processes at the Federal Aviation Administration, America’s aviation regulator, was so respected that other countries deferred to its judgement in reciprocal arrangements. But now officials in Europe and Canada want to conduct their own tests before letting the MAX back in their skies. They were dismayed and alarmed by the reluctance of the FAA to ground the jet after the second crash in Ethiopia. Some suspect that Boeing’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/business/2019/03/23/regulatory-capture-may-be-responsible-for-boeings-recent-problems&quot;&gt;cosy relationship&lt;/a&gt; with its regulator may have skewed its judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite these difficulties, Boeing’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/gulliver/2019/04/07/why-boeings-shares-have-not-fallen-further-after-the-737-max-crashes&quot;&gt;share price&lt;/a&gt; is up just under a fifth since the start of the year. Investors think airlines will stand by their MAX orders given that Airbus, Boeing’s European competitor, has no spare capacity to produce more of its rival A320neo jet. But Boeing has already slowed the rate at which it assembles MAXs, down from 52 to 42 aircraft per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;In any case, its 5,000-strong orderbook for MAX jets looks vulnerable. Garuda, an Indonesian carrier, is cancelling its 49 orders. Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines—the two carriers that have lost MAX aircraft—are unlikely to honour their 212 orders. Other big operators might use the grounding as an excuse for trimming commitments. Even airlines loyal to the manufacturer will hit Boeing with hefty compensation bills for the extra costs that they have incurred since the planes were grounded. And the relatives of the 346 dead are likely to sue the aircraft manufacturer in great numbers as well. Boeing will not be ruined by this crisis. But nor will it emerge unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 19:07:38 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine elects Volodymyr Zelensky, TV star and political neophyte]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/04/22/ukraine-elects-volodymyr-zelensky-tv-star-and-political-neophyte]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/000_1ft9pb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-22T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 22nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;WITH DANCE music blaring, drinks flowing, and ping-pong balls flying about, Volodymyr Zelensky’s election-day headquarters in Kiev felt like a nightclub. Mr Zelensky (pictured) had reason to party: as expected, the comedian-cum-candidate trounced the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, in the presidential run-off election on April 21st. He racked up a stunning 73% of the vote against the president’s 24%. Despite having no political experience and only a vague policy platform, voters entrusted him with the helm of a country that needs radical reform and is still enmeshed in a simmering war with Russia. Best known for playing a schoolteacher who becomes president in a popular TV series called “Servant of the People”, Mr Zelensky entered his election-night festivities to the theme song from the show he has made a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A native Russian-speaker of Jewish heritage hailing from the south-eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, Mr Zelensky galvanised support from across the country. He carried all but one of the 25 Ukrainian regions where voting was held. (Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, did not hold an election.) His slick campaign targeted voters online and through social media, while largely eschewing conventional campaigning in the form of rallies and interviews. He offered broadly popular promises to maintain Ukraine’s Western-leaning course, to end the war, and to fight corruption, while proffering few specifics and promising to crowdsource important appointments and policies. He emerged as the projection of voters’ frustration with Mr Poroshenko’s checkered leadership and of their hopes for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread fears about challenges to the legitimacy of the vote, election day passed off smoothly. An emboldened civil society and free press helped hold politicians to account. “Information has been plentiful and accessible, no one has pressured me, this is my choice,” one Kievan nurse said after casting a vote for Mr Zelensky. Mr Poroshenko conceded promptly, promising to “accept the will of the Ukrainian people”. Five years after its revolution, Ukraine has seen competitive elections unseat a sitting president in a peaceful transition of power—a rarity in the post-Soviet region and a genuinely impressive achievement. In his first remarks after exit polls became public, Mr Zelensky nodded to this reality, and the example it may set: “To all the countries of the former Soviet Union: look at us, everything is possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Poroshenko’s campaign was a crude appeal to patriotism. He ran under the slogan of “Army, Language, Faith”, playing up his successes at securing an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church and visa-free travel to the European Union. He sought to paint Mr Zelensky as dangerously inexperienced and beholden to outside interests. “He is a bright candy wrapper,” Mr Poroshenko said in a debate ahead of the vote. “There are Russians inside and fugitive oligarchs,” he added, referring to Mr Zelensky’s murky ties with Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial oligarch whose TV channel airs his shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the successes and the reservations about his opponent were reasonable points to draw attention to. But voters instead focused on Mr Poroshenko’s failure to fulfil the promises of the revolution that swept him to power five years ago. With corruption still rife and GDP per head in Ukraine the lowest in Europe, just 9% of Ukrainians have confidence in their government, the lowest level in the world. “I voted for Poroshenko [in 2014], but things haven’t got better,” said Nadezhda Tsaplyuk, who voted for Mr Zelensky in the district in Kiev where Mr Poroshenko won more support than anywhere else in the city in 2014. “Sure we have visa-free [travel to the EU], but I don’t have the money to go anywhere.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This malaise fuelled Mr Zelensky’s rise. Many Ukrainians expressed their choice in terms of opposition to the current regime, rather than enthusiasm for the candidate himself. “People are voting against the old authorities,” Daniil Bychenok, an 18-year-old student, said. “We don’t know what we’re voting for.” In the run-up to the vote, polls showed that 60% of those who planned to support Mr Zelensky saw it as a protest vote. “Zelensky is winning because we can’t live like this any longer,” says Vladimir Bazhanov, a pensioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectations for Mr Zelensky, in turn, are as high as confidence in the current regime is low. “He’ll jail a few of them and everything will get better,” Olga Podolskaya, a retired lawyer, predicted hopefully. Promising vague but radical change proved to be an effective campaign strategy. But Mr Zelensky may struggle to fulfill the hopes voters have for him. “People are waiting for a miracle, but there won’t be any miracles,” Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst, said ahead of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his huge victory, Mr Zelensky will face many challenges once he takes office. Rival parties will still control parliament, the Rada, which holds significant power in Ukraine’s mixed system. He will need to turn his new party, Servant of the People, named after his TV show, into a real political machine if he wants to gain control of the Rada in the autumn. Vladimir Putin still has many tools to put pressure on his new counterpart. Ukraine’s loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund stipulates further increases in household gas prices this year, measures that have already proved deeply unpopular. Disappointment from unmet expectations, in fact, is the subject of the second season of Mr Zelensky’s show, entitled “From Love to Impeachment”. As one Zelensky aide says, “We know what can happen: we wrote this all already.” After the post-election buzz wears off, the thankless reality of governing will begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 18:06:53 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A massacre on Easter in Sri Lanka kills at least 290 people]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/21/a-massacre-on-easter-in-sri-lanka-kills-at-least-290-people]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_blp901.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-21T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (22nd April 2019):&lt;/strong&gt; This is a moving news story. The death toll will be updated as it rises. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT HAS BEEN nearly ten years since the guns fell silent in Sri Lanka’s civil war. But bloodshed returned with a vengeance on Easter Sunday when a succession of explosions ripped through three churches packed with worshippers, and three five-star hotels. At least 290 people were killed and hundreds more were injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coincidence of the attacks with the upcoming anniversary of the Sri Lankan army’s defeat of the Tamil Tiger rebels on May 19th—ending a war that pitted the ethnic Tamil and a largely Hindu minority, against the Sinhalese Buddhist majority—may be just that. The authorities are being cautious about apportioning blame, particularly because of the recent history of communal violence on the island, both during and after the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior police official said there were signs the six blasts were all suicide bombings. This was a favourite tactic of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, but no fingers are being pointed at any Tamil groups. And suicide tactics, especially aimed at religious targets and foreign tourists, are also a hallmark of international jihadist groups. Yet the country has little history of jihadist activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions were the deadliest attacks in the country since the end of the war. They took place in close succession beginning at around 8.30am. The first was at the St Sebastian Church in Negombo, a Catholic-majority area. Photographs showed tiles blown off a blackened roof and bloodied bodies on the ground. Two other explosions occurred at St Anthony’s Church in Colombo (another Catholic church), and at the Zion Church (Evangelical) in Batticaloa, around 220km east of the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 30 minutes later, there were explosions at the Shangri-La, the Kingsbury and the Cinnamon Grand hotels in Colombo. All are five-star venues and many of the victims were enjoying Easter breakfast special offers. At least 11 foreigners were confirmed killed. Among the nationalities were Indian, Turkish, Portuguese, British and joint US-UK nationals. The authorities counted the bodies of 25 more people presumed to be foreign. The US State Department said “several” Americans had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two more explosions took place later in the day, in which eight people were killed, but they appear to be related to security forces’ raids on terrorists’ suspected hideouts. Seven people were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main hospital in Colombo was a scene of chaos, with hysterical relatives swarming the narrow road leading to the emergency unit amid a steady flow of ambulances. As news of the attacks spread via social media, police rushed to churches around the country and sent worshippers home. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the head of the Catholic church, cancelled all other services. Security forces were later deployed to guard churches, hotels and the international airport. The government cancelled school for children whose new terms were starting Monday. Universities were declared indefinitely closed. A countrywide police curfew came into effect in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever the perpetrators may be, there are worries that the blasts will stir renewed inter-communal strife. Of Sri Lanka’s population of more than 20m people, about 75% are Sinhalese (who are mostly Buddhists). Tamils, living mostly in the north and east, make up about 11% and are predominantly Hindu. The rebellion by the Tamil Tigers lasted for 27 years. Muslims make up about 9% of the population and speak Tamil. Although they did not join the Tamil Tigers’s rebellion—and indeed some were evicted from the north by them—after the war Muslims have become the target of Buddhist-nationalist attacks. Christians, mostly Roman Catholics, make up about 7% of the population and straddle the Sinhalese-Tamil divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The puzzle was why the Catholic church was targeted,” said Jayadeva Uyangoda, a political scientist. The spread of Catholicism dates to 1505 with Portuguese colonisation and subsequent proselytisation. Catholics permeate all levels of governance, the private sector and even the army, but they were not a particular focus of Tamil Tiger attacks during the civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St Anthony’s church is patronised by both Tamils and Sinhalese, including non-Christians. Any assaults in recent times against Christians—also by Buddhist extremist groups—have been aimed against new Evangelical churches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence the speculation about “foreign actors”, as Cardinal Ranjith put it—in particular Muslim extremists. Only a few dozen Sri Lankan Muslims are thought to have joined the tens of thousands of foreigners who volunteered to fight with the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Some have worried about more radical forms of Islam being introduced to the island by contact with foreign preachers. Most alarming, in January Sri Lankan police said they uncovered a large cache of explosives at an IS training camp in the north of the country; it was apparently intended for use against several Buddhist monuments in the ancient city of Anuradhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason to worry about the possible radicalisation of Muslims is that Sinhalese Buddhist extremists have sought to instigate and co-ordinate mob violence against them. A traffic incident in 2018 in which a Sinhalese truck driver was assaulted by four Muslim men (and subsequently died) resulted in days of attacks on Muslim homes and businesses and a large number of injuries. In 2014, there was Buddhist-Muslim sectarian violence in several towns in the south fired by the racist speech by a Buddhist monk, Galagodatte Gnarasara, who is now in prison for contempt of court (on a separate matter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Easter bombings, as rumours and incendiary anti-Muslim comments spread like wildfire, the government swiftly shut down all social-media platforms, including WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the hunt for the perpetrators begins, Sri Lanka will be counting the cost of a day of carnage it had not expected. The Catholic church is preparing for mass funerals, which the government has said it will pay for. The country as a whole has suffered a blow to its lucrative tourism sector. Until Easter day it had enjoyed a reputation as one of the safest countries for holidaymakers. That has changed utterly, along with much else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 18:06:52 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A massacre on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka kills 290 people]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/21/a-massacre-on-easter-sunday-in-sri-lanka-kills-290-people]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_blp901.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-21T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (22nd April 2019):&lt;/strong&gt; This is a moving news story.

Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the head of the Catholic church, cancelled all other services. Security forces were later deployed to guard churches, hotels and the international airport. The government cancelled school for children whose new terms were starting Monday. Universities were declared indefinitely closed. A countrywide police curfew came into effect in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever the perpetrators may be, there are worries that the blasts will stir renewed inter-communal strife. Of Sri Lanka’s population of more than 20m people, about 75% are Sinhalese (who are mostly Buddhists). Tamils, living mostly in the north and east, make up about 11% and are predominantly Hindu. The rebellion by the Tamil Tigers lasted for 27 years. Muslims make up about 9% and speak Tamil. Although they did not join the Tamil Tigers’s rebellion—and indeed some were evicted from the north by them—after the war Muslims have become the target of Budhist nationalist attacks. Christians, mostly Roman Catholics, make up about 7% of the population and straddle the Sinhalese-Tamil divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The puzzle was why the Catholic church was targeted,” said Jayadeva Uyangoda, a political scientist. The spread of Catholicism dates to 1505 with Portuguese colonisation and subsequent proselytization. Catholics permeate all levels of governance, the private sector and even the army, but they were not a particular focus of Tamil Tiger attacks during the civil war.&lt;br/&gt;St Anthony’s church is patronised by both Tamils and Sinhalese, including non-Christians. Any assaults in recent times against Christians—also by Buddhist extremist groups—have been aimed against new Evangelical churches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence the speculation about “foreign actors”, as Cardinal Ranjith put it—in particular Muslim extremists. Only a few dozen Sri Lankan Muslims are thought to have joined the tens of thousands of foreigners who volunteered to fight with the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Some have worried about more radical forms of Islam being introduced to the island by contact with foreign preachers. Most alarming, in January Sri Lankan police said they uncovered a large cache of explosives at an IS training camp in the north of the country; it was apparently intended for use against several Buddhist monuments in the ancient city of Anuradhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason to worry about the possible radicalisation of Muslims is that Sinhalese Buddhist extremists have sought to instigate and coordinate mob violence against them. A traffic incident in 2018 in which a Sinhalese truck driver was assaulted by four Muslim men (and subsequently died) resulted in days of attacks on Muslim homes and businesses and a large number of injuries. Earlier, in 2014, there was Buddhist-Muslim sectarian violence in several towns in the south fired by the racist speech by a Buddhist monk, Galagodatte Gnarasara, who is now in prison for contempt of court (on a separate matter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Easter bombings, as rumours and incendiary anti-Muslim comments spread like wildfire, the government swiftly shut down all social-media platforms, including WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the hunt for the perpetrators begins, Sri Lanka will be counting the cost of a day of carnage it had not expected. The Catholic church is preparing for mass funerals, which the government has said it will pay for. The country as a whole has suffered a blow to its lucrative tourism sector. Until Easter day it had enjoyed a reputation as one of the safest countries for holidaymakers. That has changed utterly, along with much else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 02:06:34 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
