Yet it is roundly criticised for being unwelcoming to women, in ways large and small. In America, women hold just 25% of jobs in computing, and leave the tech and engineering sectors at twice the rate of men. The situation is worse for women of colour: black women hold only 3% of jobs among women in tech, and Latina women just 1% in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gender imbalance is a global problem. In Britain, for example, Europe’s main tech hub, just 15% of people working in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields are women. Only 5% of leadership positions are occupied by women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Brotopia: Breaking up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley”, Emily Chang, a journalist at Bloomberg, explores the difficulties that women face. Start-up culture is often like a college fraternity house, which makes it hard for women to fit in, especially in senior management. Ms Chang recounts female engineers at Uber describing how they were invited to strip clubs by their male colleagues, for example. Meanwhile, female venture capitalists are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future initiative, we asked Ms Chang about how the tech industry could be more hospitable to women, how the gender imbalance in venture capital could be redressed and how sexism in tech differs from other industries. Her answers appear after an excerpt from “Brotopia” on the ugly experiences faced by women in gaming.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*       *      *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190504_opp503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190504_opp503.jpg 200w,

It started in 2014, when Wu spoke up to defend women in the gaming industry, only to find herself plunged into a roiling controversy called Gamergate that turned her life upside down. The threats of rape and murder hurled at her online became so scary that she and her husband fled their home. To this day, they live in a new location under an alias. But sometimes the trolls still manage to track her down, and online harassment becomes an off-line ambush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They found our address and smashed a window of my house. Threw a brick right through it,” Wu told me in April 2017, when I reached her by phone at a number she instructed me never to share. At the time we spoke, the window was still shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online attacks, like the one perpetrated on Wu, began and gathered force on sites like 4chan, Twitter, and Reddit, the largely unmonitored town halls of the web. All of these sites allow or encourage anonymity and pseudonymity, as well as a laissez-faire approach to free speech, in keeping with the long-standing libertarian ethos of the internet. All of them have tolerated years of online harassment of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be of little surprise at this point that the sites that harbour the most vicious trolls—4chan, Twitter, and Reddit included—were all started and led by white men, who aren’t usually the targets of the most vicious online harassment. Would these sites be as hostile to women today if they had been built and run by women, or at least included a meaningful number of women leaders early on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The money in misogyny&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few places on the internet are more troubled by misogynistic trolling than the world of online gaming. Gaming is a billion-dollar business— much bigger than movies and rivaling TV—including an exploding generation of mobile and social games, classic PC console games, and rising categories like e-sports and virtual reality. Yet the gaming industry is also saddled with a long-standing history of violence toward and degradation of women, allowing gamers to play out dozens of dark fantasies. One of the earliest rape-simulation games, Custer’s Revenge, was released in 1982 by the game maker Mystique. The goal was to rape a Native American woman tied to a cactus, with points awarded for every thrust. More than three decades later, our most popular games feature similar scenes. In Take-Two Interactive’s monster hit Grand Theft Auto (whose fifth iteration is one of the bestselling video games of all time), players can sleep with a prostitute, then murder her. Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, has defended the game, saying, “It is art. And I embrace that art, and it’s beautiful art, but it is gritty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the broader tech industry, gaming has systematically excluded women for decades. In 2016, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) reported that women make up just 22 percent of game developers, with men vastly outnumbering them in management and in powerful technical roles such as programming, software engineering, and technical design. Interestingly, the IGDA also found that men were much less likely than women to believe that diversity in the industry, and in the games it produces, was important. Indeed, women have also been poorly represented in the games themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the report drily puts it, “Women have long experienced derogatory representations of their gender in videogame content as well as a general invisibility within the wider videogame culture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising, then, that the most notorious case of online trolling sprang out of the gaming industry and that women were the targets. Gamergate was sparked in 2014 by the peevish post of an unhappy former boyfriend of one of the gaming industry’s few female developers. “This is written almost entirely in shitty metaphors and bitter snark,” wrote Eron Gjoni, an industry coder. “It’s a post about an ex.” Gjoni alleged that his former girlfriend, the game developer Zoe Quinn, had slept with other people in the gaming industry while she and Gjoni were dating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reasons that are still somewhat inexplicable, the missive unleashed a volcanic explosion of hate, all of it directed at Quinn, who was a feminist critic of mainstream video games. Though Gjoni never called for any kind of campaign against Quinn, a certain subset of gamers took his nine-thousand-word, she-done-me-wrong post and turned it into a rallying point from which to defend their sacred, mostly male gaming territory. They derided Quinn’s game development as basic, simplistic girl work and claimed she used sexual favors to get good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gjoni’s post was put up on 4chan (not by him, he would later attest), an online community founded in 2003 by a then-teenager named Christopher Poole. Today 4chan claims some twenty million monthly visitors, including a large population that seems to delight in wreaking havoc online. They were particularly vicious when attacking Quinn and other women in the gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 4chan members engaged in the fight, accounts sprang up across Twitter and Reddit to attack Quinn and spread the #Gamergate hashtag. The trolling expanded to target other female game developers on the premise that there was a conspiracy among women trying to ruin the industry by promoting more gender equality in the games themselves and in the studios where the products are produced. The Gamergaters created and shared lists of industry women to target and torment, including Anita Sarkeesian, a media critic who had risen to prominence by calling out sexism in the video game industry. The trolls even created a game called Beat Up Anita Sarkeesian, which enabled users to punch her virtual face. The game’s creators wrote, “There’s been a disgusting large imbalance of women who get beaten up in games. Let’s add a lady . . . She claims to want equality: Well, here it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once riled, many internet trolls have no shame. They often compete with each other to see who can be the most cruel. And as Quinn and Sarkeesian found out, they don’t limit their attacks and threats to a single individual. They will threaten family members, including children. They will also instantly direct their bile toward anyone who comes to the target’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is where Brianna Wu enters the story. About two months after Gjoni’s post, Wu, an established game designer, spoke out against the #Gamergate campaign, sarcastically tweeting a meme suggesting that the trolls were saving everyone from an “apocalyptic future” where women might have slightly more influence in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when all hell broke loose. Shortly after responding to the trolls on Twitter, Wu was inundated with violent, disturbing threats on her life. One series of tweets in particular stands out. “Guess what bitch, I now know where you live;” “Your mutilated corpse will be on the front page of Jezebel tomorrow;” and “If you have any kids, they’re going to die too.” As the threats piled up, Wu and her husband fled their home, crashing on friends’ couches and hiding out in extended- stay hotels. They didn’t have children to worry about, but they did spend an inordinate amount of money boarding their dog while they were on the run. Wu had a choice to make: speak up for what was right or be silenced. She chose to talk back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was angry. I was scared. I was terrified. But within all of that I was trying to reach inside myself and find that bravery to really change the industry for women,” Wu told me. She spent days documenting the dozens of death threats against her so she could provide them to law enforcement officials. At the height of the online vitriol, she hired a full-time staff member to help collect information on her harassers to share with police, but none of that was enough to bring the perpetrators to justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu wasn’t alone. Others who spoke out in support of Quinn or even mildly criticized the trolls or the gaming industry were similarly attacked. Kellee Santiago, a female game developer who went on to work at Google, likened Gamergate to a witch hunt or public stoning, telling me, “It was really shocking to discover that I live in a time and place in which such animosity toward women existed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troll army on the march&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu would later understand that she had been the victim of the trolling playbook, an extremely effective technique used to silence women that anonymous social-media denizens disagree with. &amp;quot;Find the woman and identify something in her past to distort her with,&amp;quot; Wu explains. &amp;quot;If she&amp;#x27;s gay, attack her on that. Larger than size 12? Attack her on that. Transgender? Attack her on that. Find the spot where the woman feels most vulnerable and make her feel unsafe until the cost of speaking out is too great.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of the troll playbook is not limited to the fans or members of the gaming industry. Online harassment is not one of the most disturbing problems plaguing the internet at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;______________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excerpted from “Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley” by Emily Chang, with permission of Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC. Copyright © Emily Chang, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*       *      *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; Is sexism in tech better or worse than in other industries, and does it take on a different form?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Chang:&lt;/strong&gt; “Brotopia” is everywhere, but what makes Silicon Valley’s sexism problem especially troubling is the fact that the tech industry is changing our lives faster than any other industry in the world. Women hold 25% of jobs across the industry, account for 9% of venture capital investors and women-led companies get just 2% of venture capital funding. And yet, Silicon Valley is deciding what we read, how we communicate, what we buy.  It is rapidly reshaping our culture, and yet the vast majority of the decisions made in tech are made by men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of women in Silicon Valley is having an outsized impact on our lives and our children’s lives. Amazon’s facial recognition technology gets white men right almost 100% of the time and darker-skinned women wrong 31% of the time. Imagine being accused of a crime because the tech got it wrong? That kind of bias will enshrine and exacerbate the inequalities that already exist in our society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For another example, Twitter cofounder Evan Williams told me he thinks if more women had been on the team from the very beginning, perhaps online harassment and trolling wouldn’t be such a problem on the platform. The men who were building the product didn’t think about how it could be weaponised. Imagine if the internet were a friendlier, healthier place, how different might the world be? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else that sets Silicon Valley apart is the entrenched belief among the powerbrokers that they are not only changing the world but changing the world “for the better.” That confidence creates a sense of moral exceptionalism and arrogance that distances Silicon Valley from real-world people and problems. In fact, the tech industry faces many of the same issues that other industries face with sexism, racism and ageism, but is blind to it, which means there is even less of an urgency to change Silicon Valley itself for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190504_opp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190504_opp502.jpg 200w,

We are seeing progress at companies where leadership has made this a top priority. The workplace collaboration startup Slack is a good case study. Rather than focusing on unconscious bias training alone, Slack has focused on giving their employees tools to combat their biases—standardising their recruiting, interview and review processes. Rather than complaining about the “pipeline problem,” the real-estate tech company Redfin hired women with non-traditional backgrounds, and recruited women from their marketing team and taught them how to code. It worked! Those women are getting promoted at the same rates as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a diverse team doesn’t have to take forever and inclusion can start today. All companies need to think harder about how to create cultures where everyone who is at the table also has a voice at the table, and can be the best versions of themselves. We’ve seen a lot of agitation among employees at companies like Google and Amazon for more inclusive workplaces that has made a difference. Employees themselves have a more powerful voice than ever before and should use their voices to make change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; According to a Pew survey in 2018, around half of Americans thought that #MeToo has made it harder for men to know how to interact with women in the workplace. Do you think there is any validity to such concerns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Chang:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a good thing that the #MeToo movement has made some people question their behavior. Hopefully this leads to better behavior and better workplace practices. I do believe the folks who think that #MeToo will backfire on women are mistaken. The conversations and policy changes that are happening right now are essential to move workplace culture forward. There might be some additional nerves and uncertainty in the meantime, but it is an important part of a broader shift to ensure that women can reach their full potential in the workforce, which will benefit us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of women of colour in tech is incredibly disappointing, just 3-4% of Google employees are black. Are a different set of policies necessary to address the plight of “double minorities”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Chang:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies need to make sure that they are focused on improving all kinds of diversity and improving their cultures to support employees of all different backgrounds. Diversity isn’t just about gender. It’s about race, sexuality, age, socioeconomic background and more. If you are a “double minority” or a “triple minority,” you can double or triple how hard it might be to navigate your own workplace. I do think tech companies should set specific goals around race, in the rank and file, leadership and on the board, given how dismal the numbers are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; Should venture capitalists try to play a role in addressing tech’s gender imbalance, such as signaling to entrepreneurs that they look favourably on startups that have diverse workforces? Or is that idea madness because it interferes with what perhaps should be their sole goal: investing in companies with the best shot at success?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Chang:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely! Venture capitalists have a huge role to play in making sure they are surfacing and investing in the entrepreneurs and ideas with the most potential. Investors are the “kingmakers” of Silicon Valley but they can and should be “queenmakers” as well. Given that women-led companies only received 2% of venture funding, it is painfully obvious that investors are not surfacing the best ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, funding is often doled out based on networks and “warm” introductions and these networks are dominated by men. Many venture firms have zero female partners and some are just hiring their first female partner in decades. In 2018, a group of women investors in Silicon Valley joined together to form a nonprofit called All Raise to increase the number of women investors and the number of women getting funded. They have already raised an incredible amount of awareness around these issues and I’m very hopeful their activism will play an important part of balancing the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 23:06:44 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The sitcom that spawned a president]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/news/2019/05/03/the-sitcom-that-spawned-a-president]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190504_efp001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-03T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 3rd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/20190406_opp602_apple_news.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/articles/20190406_opp602_apple_news.jpg 200w,

It was published in the April/May 2019 issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president of Ukraine sits in his office, a glum look on his face. He has just been trounced in the election by a political outsider, and isn’t taking it well. When his successor, Vasyl Holoborodko, tries to move into his office, the outgoing president shoots at him through the door with a shotgun, just missing his target. He’s refusing to leave until his demands are met, says an aide: he wants a litre of vodka, several packs of cigarettes and political asylum in Yugoslavia. “But Yugoslavia doesn’t even exist anymore,” says Holoborodko. “He knows, that’s why he asked for the vodka,” the aide replies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mix of slapstick and satire is typical of “Servant of the People”, a television show that has gripped Ukrainian audiences since 2015. In an astonishing example of life imitating art, Volodymyr Zelensky, the actor and comedian who plays Holoborodko, was elected this month as Ukraine’s president. Despite having no political experience whatsoever, he managed to defeat Petro Poroshenko, the incumbent of five years, with a whopping 73% of the vote. Poroshenko graciously accepted defeat and congratulated Zelensky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleksey Kiryushchenko, the actor who plays Zelensky’s on-screen opponent, is also the showrunner of “Servant of the People”, responsible for developing the storyline and producing and directing the show. But now that his star is too busy having meetings with foreign dignitaries and members of parliament, Kiryushchenko is saying goodbye. “We can’t have the show without its hero,” he tells me matter of factly. We are sitting in the canteen of Kvartal 95, Zelensky’s production company, which is housed in a converted Soviet apartment block in Kiev. “There were three seasons, and the fourth is happening now before our eyes,” Kiryushchenko tells me. “It has become reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kiryushchenko was asked to work on “Servant of the People” four years ago, nobody on set seemed to think that the show would be renewed for a second season. Zelensky and his writers knew that the protagonist of their story would be an everyman-turned-politician, but they were struggling to put a fresh spin on a familiar archetype. For inspiration they watched “House of Cards”, “Yes, Minister” and “Boss”, starring Kelsey Grammer. In the end, they decided to set their story firmly in the 21st century: their hero, a Ukrainian schoolteacher, is elected president after his rant against the country’s corrupt establishment goes viral after being secretly filmed and uploaded to YouTube by a student. Zelensky’s character, Vasyl Holoborodko, reluctantly moves into the presidential residence. He resolves to purge Ukraine of corruption but, almost immediately, everyone from his bank clerk to the country’s most powerful oligarchs seek to buy his favour. The question tugging at the minds of viewers is whether Holoborodko will resist the urge to use his office to enrich himself or succumb to it, like so many before him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The show is an experiment,” Kiryushchenko says. “We see what happens when you drop an idealistic person into dirty politics, like a clean spoon full of honey into a barrel of tar.” That experiment has been wildly successful. “Servant of the People” was a hit, and is the only Ukrainian programme ever bought by Netflix. Tired of their scandal-ridden politics (Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe after Russia according to Transparency International), Ukrainians found in Holoborodko a man who not only entertained them but who also promised to defend their interests against those who would ransack the country. Holoborodko gave his fans hope for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Zelensky. He announced his candidacy on New Year’s Eve last year. Though Kiryushchenko is careful to say that Zelensky didn’t consult him while he was thinking about a run for office, he does recall one conversation they had during that period.“‘You are doing satire,’ I told him. ‘What’s the goal? You want him [Poroshenko] to change? You want him to become better. You criticise him at first gently, then harder and harder, and he doesn’t change. So are you going to do that into old age, barking at his feet like a little dog? Maybe change places and become him yourself.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_EFP002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190504_EFP002.jpg 200w,

The latest season of the show was broadcast during the election campaign. As viewers watched Holoborodko rooting out corruption on screen, they observed his real-life avatar, backed by a political party called “Servant of the People”, criticising Poroshenko and championing ideas first mooted by Holoborodko, such as getting rid of the presidential motorcade which Holoborodko thought frivolous. Zelensky even once addressed his social media audience while he was on set and in costume, and took to the stage on election night as the show’s theme music played on the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do you think Zelensky would have won if it wasn’t for Holoborodko?” Kiryushchenko asks rhetorically. “People believe in Zelensky’s character on the show and can’t separate them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiryushchenko claims that he, Zelensky and their team had no idea that their show would prove a highly effective means of mobilising voters. “The show ended up being a new kind of political technology,” he says, using a post-Soviet term for the techniques used to influence voters. “For the world that was a really unexpected political shock. But we didn’t plan that. I would love to say we did, that we have some sort of know-how in political technology. I would have a million offers on my desk from people asking me to do the same thing for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Zelensky’s appeal is that he is a political outsider, one who isn’t in the pocket of the oligarchs, or so he claims. His opponents disagree. “Servant of the People” is aired on 1+1, a popular TV channel which provided favourable coverage of Zelensky during the campaign. Poroshenko has accused Zelensky of being the puppet of the owner of 1+1, an oligarch called Ihor Kolomoisky. Zelensky denies the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other concerns abound. Many Ukrainians worry about Zelensky’s lack of experience. He may be able to act the part of a president but when the cameras are turned off and the real work begins, what then? He readily admits that his political views aren’t well developed; when a BBC journalist met him in January, the journalist described those views as “still very much a work in progress”. Zelensky has responded to reports that he came across as clueless in briefings with diplomats by promising to surround himself with eggheads. But at a particularly fraught time for the country, which is still at war with Russia, some may reasonably wonder whether Zelensky is fit for office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens with Zelensky’s presidency, “Servant of the People” is on the verge of going global. Even before Zelensky was elected, media companies in over 15 countries, including Fox Studios in America, had bought the rights to remake the series, creating the possibility that copycats will try to launch their own political careers via the characters they play on screen. “I opened Pandora’s box,” admits Kiryushchenko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Bateson is a journalist based in Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 23:06:43 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“This is part of a brewing fight between Donald Trump and Congress”]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/03/this-is-part-of-a-brewing-fight-between-donald-trump-and-congress]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/william_barr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-03T11:50:07Z&quot;&gt;May 3rd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE REFUSAL of America’s attorney-general, William Barr, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/05/02/donald-trump-is-not-the-first-president-to-fight-subpoenas&quot;&gt;testify&lt;/a&gt; before Congress on Thursday is just the latest example of the White House’s stonewalling policy.

Voters fed up with the political impasse in Westminster, nearly three years after the referendum to leave the European Union, lashed out at both the Conservatives and Labour in local elections on May 2nd. Instead, they gave their support to smaller parties that offered any sort of alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-morning on May 3rd, with results still coming in, a pattern had emerged. The Conservatives had performed badly across the board, losing ground in both Remain-voting areas, which balked at the Tories’ hard line on Europe, and staunchly Leave parts of the country, where voters felt the party too soft on the topic. But so had Labour, which fell back sharply in Leave-voting areas in the north and midlands. When it comes to Brexit, voters seem happy to dish out the blame equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where a viable third option existed, voters jumped at it. The Liberal Democrats were the main beneficiaries. By 9am the morning after the vote, they had won eight councils, mainly from the Conservatives. The Green Party also did well, picking up 40 seats, after a brief lull in the Brexit coverage pushed the environment to the top of news bulletins in the weeks running up to the vote. Independents, meanwhile, mopped up. In Ashfield, a former mining community in the midlands, the Ashfield Independents romped home with 30 of 35 seats. An independent candidate in Middlesbrough’s mayoral election hammered his Labour opponent. By 9am more than 200 independent candidates had won seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loyalists from the two main parties offered excuses for the poor performance. The Conservatives were defending a big haul of seats won in 2015, when local elections came at the same time as their surprise general-election victory under David Cameron. By contrast, Labour had a torrid day in 2015 and is on track for another bad one this time. The party’s defenders point out that these elections were dominated by rural seats, where Labour is weak anyway—a fact the party has no plans to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lib Dems were quick to hail a triumph. Sir Ed Davey, the party’s home-affairs spokesman, labelled it the best result in a generation. It is true that they performed well, but the party is making up ground lost during their unhappy years in coalition with the Conservatives, rather than converting swathes to the Lib Dem faith. Between 2010 and 2015 the Lib Dems’ share of the vote in general elections fell from 23% to 8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Curtice, a veteran pollster, suggested a cheap bottle of champagne or a prosecco was in order, rather than the good stuff. What it does demonstrate is that the Lib Dems are far from a spent force. The main pitch from a new pro-Remain centrist outfit, Change UK, is that the Lib Dems are fit only for the knackers; these results show that voters disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results will dribble in for the rest of the day, including from bellwether seats such as Darlington, in the north-east, and from Northern Ireland. What is clear already is that there is no Brexit dividend for either Labour or the Conservatives. Voters fed up with the two main parties have plenty of other options, whether Lib Dem or Green (both of which offer outright opposition to Brexit), or a battered, bruised and increasingly far-right UK Independence Party, which clung on to some seats despite having fallen apart institutionally. The same trend on steroids can be expected in the European election later this month, which voters have historically used to cast a protest vote and which offers an even wider array of options (neither the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage’s new outfit which currently tops the polls, nor Change UK stood in this week’s local elections). Neither Labour nor the Conservatives will see political benefit from Brexit. But other parties will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 18:06:48 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are states equipped to tackle partisan gerrymandering on their own?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/05/02/are-states-equipped-to-tackle-partisan-gerrymandering-on-their-own]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_USP510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-02T21:48:29Z&quot;&gt;May 2nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESPITE ITS repeated refusals to curb haywire electoral maps, the Supreme Court has no great love of partisan gerrymandering. When, 33 years ago, the justices unanimously let a Republican gerrymander in Indiana &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/478/109/#tab-opinion-1956739&quot;&gt;slide&lt;/a&gt;, they said the impact on Democrats was discriminatory but not egregiously so. When in 2004 the court decided not to strike down maps favouring Republicans in Pennsylvania, four justices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/02-1580&quot;&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; that gerrymandering, while nothing to celebrate, was not a matter the judiciary could police. And in 2018, challenges to devastating gerrymanders in Wisconsin and Maryland (one for each party) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/06/19/the-supreme-court-dodges-big-decisions-on-partisan-redistricting&quot;&gt;came up short&lt;/a&gt; on procedural grounds. Despite their demurrals, the justices seem to agree that it is poor form for politicians of one party to methodically preserve their seats with precision-engineered maps. In 2017, Samuel Alito, a conservative justice unwilling to crack down on partisan draughtsmen, nevertheless called gerrymandering “distasteful”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when the justices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/03/28/the-supreme-court-does-not-like-gerrymandering&quot;&gt;took up&lt;/a&gt; the matter yet again in March, several pursued a new tack. Maybe the judiciary does not need to meddle with politically tainted line-drawing, Donald Trump’s two appointees suggested in the oral arguments, because a new political awakening is fixing the problem all by itself. Justice Neil Gorsuch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2018/18-422_5hd5.pdf&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; this line of questioning in &lt;em&gt;Rucho v Common Cause,&lt;/em&gt; a challenge to an extreme Republican gerrymander of congressional districts in North Carolina. “We’ve heard that the court must act because nobody else can as a practical matter”, Justice Gorsuch told Paul Clement, the lawyer representing the North Carolina General Assembly. But “what’s the scope of the problem here?” Seven sparsely populated states with only one congressional district have no gerrymandering (or district lines) at all, and a handful of other states have taken redistricting out of politicians’ hands. These changes, in Justice Gorsuch’s home state of Colorado as well as in California, Arizona, Michigan, New York, Missouri, Ohio and Utah, mean that nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions, not the legislatures themselves, draw the lines. And some state Supreme Courts, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/01/25/pennsylvanias-supreme-court-invalidates-the-states-congressional-map&quot;&gt;Pennsylvania&amp;#x27;s&lt;/a&gt;, are finding electoral maps invalid under state constitutions. “My sense”, Justice Gorsuch said, “is there’s a lot of movement in this area”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court’s newest member, voiced frustration with Democratic gerrymandering in his home state of Maryland. But he, too, explored the idea that the democratic process may spare the Supreme Court from stepping in. There is “a fair amount of activity going on in the states”, Justice Kavanaugh observed to Emmet Bondurant, the lawyer for the North Carolina plaintiffs. Voters are “recognising the same problem that you’re recognising” and taking action to hand map-drawing to independent commissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Bondurant’s reply, supported later in the hearing by Allison Riggs, another lawyer arguing against the skewed North Carolina maps, was a reality check. Most states that have moved to redistricting commissions in hopes of dampening the political gamesmanship in electoral map-making have got there via ballot initiatives: amendments to their state constitutions approved by voters at the polls. But many states, including most east of the Mississippi River, do not provide for such a process, and it is distinctly unlikely that state legislatures would vote to strip themselves of the power to redistrict. Neither Republicans nor Democrats have an incentive to pass off the pen to a committee that will draw maps less favourable to them in the next decade’s elections. And moves are afoot in the Pennsylvania legislature to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.witf.org/news/2019/04/house-panel-advances-changes-in-pennsylvania-judge-elections.php&quot;&gt;gerrymander&lt;/a&gt; judicial elections in response to the state Supreme Court&amp;#x27;s crackdown on a Republican-favouring congressional map.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of evidence that states are not fully equipped to handle gerrymandering on their own, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh waxed poetic about the wonders of the political process. Mr Clement did nothing to discourage them, mentioning that the House of Representatives recently voted for HR-1, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1/text#toc-H5AD53F4DB4D140C183648E0CD2DA03F9&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; which would, among other things, force all states to transfer electoral cartography from legislatures to independent commissions. Mr Clement said this was evidence that Congress, in addition to the states, “is able to take action”. He even had a response, disingenuous though it was, to Chief Justice John Roberts’s riposte that members of Congress must be “pretty happy with the way the districting has been done”. Actually, Mr Clement replied, it is remarkable that “a majority of Congress thinks that they should pass HR-1”. He did not mention that Mitch McConnell, Republican majority leader of the Senate, has declared HR-1 dead on arrival in his chamber. Nor did he clarify that it is only Democrats in the House, not “a majority of Congress”, that wants to see HR-1 become law. (Mr Clement did mention, however, that forcing legislatures to outsource their maps might be unconstitutional.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its limits, enthusiasm for democratic change is not entirely misplaced. “Slay the Dragon”, a new documentary film by Barak Goodman and Chris Durrance, detailing the increasingly sophisticated scourge of partisan gerrymandering in America, shows the power of grassroots organising. After conveying the frightful implications of computer-aided map-drawing, “Slay the Dragon” tells the story of Katie Fahy, a political neophyte who gets so fed up with election doping in her state of Michigan that she decides to do something about it. Ms Fahy builds Voters Not Politicians, an all-volunteer organisation to get a redistricting-reform amendment on the 2018 ballot. She gathers the required hundreds of thousands of signatures; fights a well-financed legal assault on the measure; wins victories in both federal and state court to keep the proposal on the ballot; and persuades 61% of Michigan voters to adopt the plan. The story is a remarkable example of how civic passion and pluck can make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the difficulty of replicating Michigan’s transition in most other states is a hard reality. And the Wolverine state’s success is allowing some justices to believe that the courts can sit back and let democracy take its course. Ms Fahy bristles when she hears this. But she and activists in other states with independent commissions may have more disappointments ahead. In 2015, a redistricting commission in Arizona barely survived a constitutional challenge at the Supreme Court. The decision was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/07/02/one-for-the-people&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and clinched by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who left the bench last summer. Chief Justice John Roberts&amp;#x27;s dissent accused the majority of &amp;quot;deliberate constitutional evasion&amp;quot;: Article I empowers only state legislatures to draw electoral lines, he wrote. With a more conservative Justice Kavanaugh now in Justice Kennedy&amp;#x27;s seat, and the pointed dissenter in the Arizona case now the swing justice, independent commissions—and America’s electoral democracy—remain vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 07:06:50 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are states equipped to tackle partisan gerrymandering on their own?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/05/03/are-states-equipped-to-tackle-partisan-gerrymandering-on-their-own]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_USP510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-03T01:48:29Z&quot;&gt;May 3rd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESPITE ITS repeated refusals to curb haywire electoral maps, the Supreme Court has no great love of partisan gerrymandering.

Justice Neil Gorsuch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2018/18-422_5hd5.pdf&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; this line of questioning in &lt;em&gt;Rucho v Common Cause,&lt;/em&gt; a challenge to an extreme Republican gerrymander of congressional districts in North Carolina. “We’ve heard that the court must act because nobody else can as a practical matter”, Justice Gorsuch told Paul Clement, North Carolina’s lawyer. But “what’s the scope of the problem here?” Seven sparsely populated states with only one congressional district have no gerrymandering (or district lines) at all, and a handful of other states have taken redistricting out of politicians’ hands. These changes, in Justice Gorsuch’s home state of Colorado as well as in California, Arizona, Michigan, New York, Missouri, Ohio and Utah, mean that nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions, not the legislatures themselves, draw the lines. And some state Supreme Courts, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/01/25/pennsylvanias-supreme-court-invalidates-the-states-congressional-map&quot;&gt;Pennsylvania&amp;#x27;s&lt;/a&gt;, are finding electoral maps invalid under state constitutions. “My sense”, Justice Gorsuch said, “is there’s a lot of movement in this area”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court’s newest member, voiced frustration with Democratic gerrymandering in his home state of Maryland. But he, too, explored the idea that the democratic process may spare the Supreme Court from stepping in. There is “a fair amount of activity going on in the states”, Justice Kavanaugh observed to Emmet Bondurant, the lawyer for the North Carolina plaintiffs. Voters are “recognising the same problem that you’re recognising” and taking action to hand map-drawing to independent commissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Bondurant’s reply, supported later in the hearing by Allison Riggs, another lawyer arguing against the skewed North Carolina maps, was a reality check. Most states that have moved to redistricting commissions in hopes of dampening the political gamesmanship in electoral map-making have got there via ballot initiatives: amendments to their state constitutions approved by voters at the polls. But many states, including most east of the Mississippi River, do not provide for such a process, and it is distinctly unlikely that state legislatures would vote to strip themselves of the power to redistrict. Neither Republicans nor Democrats have an incentive to pass off the pen to a committee that will draw maps less favourable to them in the next decade’s elections. And moves are afoot in the Pennsylvania legislature to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.witf.org/news/2019/04/house-panel-advances-changes-in-pennsylvania-judge-elections.php&quot;&gt;gerrymander&lt;/a&gt; judicial elections in response to the state Supreme Court&amp;#x27;s crackdown on a Republican-favouring congressional map.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of evidence that states are not fully equipped to handle gerrymandering on their own, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh waxed poetic about the wonders of the political process. Mr Clement did nothing to discourage them, mentioning that the House of Representatives recently voted for HR-1, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1/text#toc-H5AD53F4DB4D140C183648E0CD2DA03F9&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; which would, among other things, force all states to transfer electoral cartography from legislatures to independent commissions. Mr Clement said this was evidence that Congress, in addition to the states, “is able to take action”. He even had a response, disingenuous though it was, to Chief Justice John Roberts’s riposte that members of Congress must be “pretty happy with the way the districting has been done”. Actually, Mr Clement replied, it is remarkable that “a majority of Congress thinks that they should pass HR-1”. He did not mention that Mitch McConnell, Republican majority leader of the Senate, has declared HR-1 dead on arrival in his chamber. Nor did he clarify that it is only Democrats in the House, not “a majority of Congress”, that wants to see HR-1 become law. (Mr Clement did mention, however, that forcing legislatures to outsource their maps might be unconstitutional.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its limits, enthusiasm for democratic change is not entirely misplaced. “Slay the Dragon”, a new documentary film by Barak Goodman and Chris Durrance, detailing the increasingly sophisticated scourge of partisan gerrymandering in America, shows the power of grassroots organising. After conveying the frightful implications of computer-aided map-drawing, “Slay the Dragon” tells the story of Katie Fahy, a political neophyte who gets so fed up with election doping in her state of Michigan that she decides to do something about it. Ms Fahy builds Voters Not Politicians, an all-volunteer organisation to get a redistricting-reform amendment on the 2018 ballot. She gathers the required hundreds of thousands of signatures; fights a well-financed legal assault on the measure; wins victories in both federal and state court to keep the proposal on the ballot; and persuades 61% of Michigan voters to adopt the plan. The story is a remarkable example of how civic passion and pluck can make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the difficulty of replicating Michigan’s transition in most other states is a hard reality. And the Wolverine state’s success is allowing some justices to believe that the courts can sit back and let democracy take its course. Ms Fahy bristles when she hears this. But she and activists in other states with independent commissions may have more disappointments ahead. In 2015, a redistricting commission in Arizona barely survived a constitutional challenge at the Supreme Court. The decision was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/07/02/one-for-the-people&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and clinched by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who left the bench last summer. Chief Justice John Roberts&amp;#x27;s dissent accused the majority of &amp;quot;deliberate constitutional evasion&amp;quot;: Article I empowers only state legislatures to draw electoral lines, he wrote. With a more conservative Justice Kavanaugh now in Justice Kennedy&amp;#x27;s seat, and the pointed dissenter in the Arizona case now the swing justice, independent commissions—and America’s electoral democracy—remain vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 05:11:18 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Charlottesville’s Confederate statues are still standing]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/05/02/why-charlottesvilles-confederate-statues-are-still-standing]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_USP507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-02T20:20:51Z&quot;&gt;May 2nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINCE 1924, a bronze statue of Robert E. Lee (pictured), the Confederacy’s top general and a brutal slave owner, has stood in a park in Charlottesville, Virginia. In August 2017, a crowd of white nationalists gathered in the pretty college town to protest against the city council’s plan to remove the statue. One of them drove a car into a group of counter-demonstrators, killing a young woman, Heather Heyer. President Donald Trump’s remark that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the protests was one of the lowest points of his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years later, a legal battle over the statue of Lee and one of another Confederate general, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, drags on. On April 25th, a judge ruled that the city council could not take the statues down because of a Virginian law that forbids authorities other than the state government from removing war memorials. While, “some people obviously see Lee and Jackson as symbols of white supremacy,” Richard E. Moore, a circuit judge wrote, and “others see them as brilliant military tacticians or complex leaders at a difficult time”, their views are irrelevant; the statues are war memorials and thus protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opponents of the statues are understandably concerned. Don Gathers, former chairman of the city commission that recommended removing the statues, said he feared the ruling would embolden white supremacists, “to think they had won and to come back to Charlottesville”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle over Charlottesville’s Confederate statues echoes similar ones elsewhere. Since 2015, when a white supremacist, fond of posing for photos with the Confederate flag, slaughtered nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, there has been a concerted push to remove monuments to the Confederacy from public places across America. Proponents of the removal of such monuments point out that the majority of them were erected long after the Civil War, during the Jim Crow era of the early twentieth century. This, it is argued, makes them less war memorials than symbols of a defiant and reborn white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their defenders often argue that, notwithstanding the spirit in which they were raised, the monuments are part of America’s heritage. This argument has been broadly successful. According to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, an advocacy group, over 100 Confederate symbols including flags and place names, have been removed from public places, but over 1,500, including over 700 monuments, remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely due to state laws, like Virginia’s. When in early 2017 Charlottesville’s city council voted to remove the statue of Lee, the Monument Fund, a local group, sued, citing a law, passed in 1904—in Richmond, capital of the Confederacy—against the removal of war memorials. After Ms Heyer’s murder, the council also voted to remove a statue of Jackson (erected in 1924) and the Monument Fund updated its lawsuit to include that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states have passed such laws more recently. In 2004, Mississippi passed a law banning the removal of monuments. It was followed in 2015 by North Carolina. In 2016 Tennessee made it more difficult for the state legislature to approve monuments’ removal. In 2017, Alabama passed legislation protecting memorials that had stood on public property for 40 years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, novel ways have been found around these laws. In Memphis, Tennessee, several Confederate statues came down after the city sold the two public parks in which they stood to a non-profit organisation for a mere $1,000 each. On other occasions the laws have been flouted. Last year protestors toppled “Silent Sam” a statue of a Confederate soldier at the University of North Carolina; the university chancellor then had the monument carted away before she resigned. The laws are also being challenged in the courts, sometimes with more success than in Virginia. In January, a judge in Alabama ruled that the state law violated the rights of citizens opposed to Confederate monuments; the attorney-general has said he will appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Charlottesville, the legal wrangling will continue. As well as arguing that the statues of Lee and Jackson are not war memorials, the city council points out that the law did not originally apply to cities like Charlottesville, only to counties. (It was amended in 1997 to include cities.) The judge has yet to rule on that but the case may end up in the state’s Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That legal battle aside, Charlottesville is likely to remain in the news. Last month Joe Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president, made the violence there a central part of his official campaign launch. In his announcement video the former vice-president chastised Mr Trump for praising the white supremacists who chanted, “the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the 30s”. The president’s words, Mr Biden went on, “stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Mr Trump said he was defending those who had opposed the removal of the statue of Lee. “If you look at what I said, you will see that that question was answered perfectly,” Trump told reporters. “And I was talking about people who went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee, a great general. Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals.” Mr Biden disputed this. “Hatred was on the march, and he knew it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 05:11:17 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Caster Semenya’s case sets a big precedent for women’s sport]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/05/02/caster-semenyas-case-sets-a-big-precedent-for-womens-sport]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_IRP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-02T19:16:38Z&quot;&gt;May 2nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEW ATHLETES have been as blessed and cursed as Caster Semenya. All that the 28-year-old South African runner has ever done is run as fast as her legs could carry her—fast enough to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals over 800 metres, and to triumph in each of the last forty 800-metre races that she has entered. But her extraordinary body has also been the subject of ridicule, speculation and censure. In 2009, when she breezed to a World Championship title as an 18-year-old, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the sport’s governing organisation, announced that it was investigating whether she might be intersex—an umbrella (and misleading) term for people with a wide range of developmental conditions affecting the genitalia and gonads. To protect her privacy, the IAAF never published its findings. But it has spent the ensuing decade fighting a regulatory battle against Ms Semenya, about whether she must meet certain hormonal criteria to compete as a woman. On May 1st the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), the highest legal body in sport, ruled against her in a decision that will have wide-ranging implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court allowed the IAAF to impose a limit of 5 nanolitres of testosterone per litre of blood (nmol/L) on runners with certain intersex conditions that increase naturally occurring testosterone. The ruling covers women’s races between 400 metres and a mile. That testosterone threshold is far below the normal male range of 8-30 nmol/L, but considerably above the normal female range of 0.1-1.8 nmol/L. To continue racing over 800 metres, Ms Semenya would have to undergo hormone therapy, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, along with other nasty side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The direct impact of the court’s ruling might actually be quite small. Ms Semenya has undergone hormone therapy before, when the IAAF introduced a testosterone limit of 10 nmol/L for women across all track-and-field events in 2011. The court suspended that rule in 2015, when Dutee Chand, an Indian sprinter with abnormally high testosterone levels, disputed that there was proof that women like her received an unfair advantage in all athletic events. The IAAF has spent the ensuing years gathering data on the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its researchers presented to the court an analysis of results at past athletics championships, which showed that women with high levels of testosterone did disproportionately well in middle-distance events. They did not find such evidence for most other competitions. The court therefore allowed the IAAF to impose a tougher 5 nmol/L limit, but only for those particular races. Ms Semenya is one of a handful of runners affected. Rather than undergoing another bout of hormone therapy, which knocked about 4% off her 800-metre time, she could simply switch to the 5,000-metre race. The event is not covered by the new rules, and she won it at the South African Athletics Championships on April 26th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a few runners will have to make immediate career choices after the court’s decision. But the precedent set by the IAAF’s ruling could affect female athletes in every sport. It is by far the most prominent and detailed ruling that the court has delivered regarding biological sex, and it is a potentially far-reaching one. From now on, the CAS will almost certainly use testosterone levels to determine who should be allowed to compete in women’s events. These tests will apply not only to intersex athletes, but also to trans women, who were born male but identify as women. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had already introduced a testosterone limit of 10 nmol/L for trans women in all sports in 2016, replacing its previous requirement for athletes to have undergone genital-reconstruction surgery. It is now considering reducing the limit to 5 nmol/L. This rule change has not been tested at the court, but after Wednesday’s precedent it looks likely to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A binary code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to distinguish between men and women? If sports administrators want to maintain separate competitions for different sexes, any attempt to draw a firm biological distinction between them will miscategorise some people. That leaves them with two options. The first is to pick a binary physical characteristic, such as having—or not having—testes or a Y chromosome, a typical (but not universal) biological marker for males. The second is to pick a physical characteristic that exists on a spectrum, such as endogenous testosterone levels, and to set a threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first approach might seem more robust. Officials at the Olympics used chromosome testing to verify athletes’ sex between 1968 and 1996. But it turns out that some women who possess both Y chromosomes and testes receive no performance-enhancing effects from them. Maria José Martínez-Patiño, a Spanish hurdler, was kicked off the national athletics team (and shunned by her colleagues and boyfriend) after failing a verification test in 1985. Three years passed before geneticists could prove that her body was insensitive to testosterone, and that her intersex condition thus conferred no athletic advantage. The IAAF subsequently stopped chromosome testing, but not soon enough for Ms Patiño to save her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her case was extremely rare. Various estimates suggest that the share of intersex people in the general population ranges from 0.05% to 1.7%, depending on how broadly the concept is defined. But those figures include conditions that neither raise questions about a person’s biological sex nor confer any conceivable sporting advantage (as in Ms Patiño’s case). Over time, officials have decided that they are unwilling to exclude people who fall into this category. Their approach now is to include people in women’s sports unless they demonstrably have an unfair competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led governing bodies to the second option: picking a physical characteristic that exists on a spectrum. Scientists generally agree that testosterone is the best candidate. The hormone drives the development of male characteristics from puberty, such as bigger muscles, sturdier bones and less fat. Ross Tucker, a sports scientist who advised Ms Semenya on the case, has shown that the gap between boys’ and girls’ running times grows wider once they become teenagers, as males experience this physiological boost. In adulthood, the fastest men run about 10% faster than women. The discrepancy is even bigger for some other field events, such as javelin and pole vault. It is no coincidence that anti-doping bodies ban competitors from juicing up on testosterone artificially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One advantage of setting a testosterone threshold is that athletes such as Ms Patiño, who produce lots of it without any benefit, can lower their levels without affecting their performance. But this approach also poses lots of problems. Working out where the threshold should be is tricky. Defining femaleness on a sliding scale means that trans women, as well as intersex athletes, can qualify after hormone therapy. That is unlikely to undo all the sporting advantages of a testosterone-charged puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of reliable data complicates things further. Whereas the hormone-induced gap between male and female performance is obvious, the correlation between testosterone levels and athletic prowess within the tiny group of elite female competitors is weak. This is a select group of highly unusual people who have a similar biological and sporting profile. (Some trans women have erroneously used the weakness of this correlation within a small sample to claim that testosterone does not matter at all across the two sexes, which Mr Tucker strongly disputes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So measuring the advantages of abnormally high testosterone levels among women is tricky, which could explain why the IAAF struggled to find any sign of such effects in most of the events that it studied. The organisation’s analysis might also have had methodological flaws. It compared women whose testosterone levels are in the top third of the range against those in the bottom third, when it might be more enlightening to look at the farther extremes of the range instead. And Mr Tucker was one a trio of independent researchers who found that the IAAF’s figures were riddled with errors, such as athletes who had been double-counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes an extraordinary person, such as Ms Semenya, to demonstrate just how potent testosterone can be in women’s sport. A by-product of her first experience with hormone therapy is that we know roughly how much it hindered her performance: by 4%. But whether that is an appropriate adjustment is purely subjective. Ms Semenya thinks it is unfair: “I just want to run naturally, the way I was born,” she says. Sports officials have ultimately come to an arbitrary decision. The IAAF’s 10 and 5 nmol/L thresholds were largely based on estimating the maximum level that a non-intersex woman could naturally reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The law of comparative advantage &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guesswork becomes even sketchier for combat and contact sports, because measuring the performance of a wrestler or rugby player is much harder than timing a runner. Bone structure is also more important in these games, which gives anyone who develops a stronger skeleton at puberty a permanent advantage, regardless of how much hormone therapy they later go through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most controversial cases in these sports have involved trans women, rather than intersex ones. Such “transitioning” is a broad process that may include declaring oneself to be a woman, or undergoing hormone therapy or genital reconstruction surgery (transition goes the other way, too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon Fox, an American mixed-martial arts fighter, was pilloried by commentators and other combatants when she revealed in 2013 that she had undergone gender-reassignment surgery. One male fighter called her a “lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak”. She last appeared in the ring in 2014. Hannah Mouncey, a trans woman who had represented the Australian men’s handball team before changing gender and switching to the women’s team, was barred from the women’s Australian Football League in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliable data about the change in performance for trans women are just as scarce as for intersex ones. Joanna Harper, a scientist who is also a trans runner, and who appeared as a witness for the IAAF in Ms Semenya’s case, has conducted one of the few studies to date. Her research covered eight non-elite endurance runners who competed first as men, then as women. She found that their slower times after hormone therapy put them in roughly the same position within women’s races as they had achieved within men’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the data are far too scant to say that this pattern holds for all athletes in every sport. If a handful of trans women fare better in elite women’s events than they did in men’s—suggesting that they have maintained an unusually large athletic advantage, even after hormone therapy—then sports administrators could find that the testosterone threshold creates a bigger quandary than chromosome tests did. Rather than cruelly ending the career of a few athletes such as Ms Patiño, they could reduce the chances of victory for a large number of women who would struggle to beat disproportionately successful trans competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Harper points out that there has been no deluge of trans women gaming the system. The trans athlete who has come closest to dominating an individual sport is Laurel Hubbard, a New Zealander who held junior national weightlifting records as a man and then became an international contender as a woman. In 2017 she finished second in the World Championships, and was leading at the Commonwealth Games in 2018 before an elbow injury. It was only in 2016 that trans women could compete in women’s events without having undergone genital-reconstruction surgery—which only a small proportion of trans people do. Not a single trans athlete has yet competed in the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the possibility remains that the testosterone threshold could allow several pretty good male competitors to reign supreme after transitioning to become women. Many women worry that such champions are imminent. Some trans women accuse them of scaremongering. Only the passage of time and collection of more data will prove who is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what happens, the court’s ruling on Ms Semenya’s case confirms that the definition of what it means to be female in sport will from now on be set on a sliding scale. If anybody thought that the decade-long dispute would clarify the matter, they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 04:08:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jihadism in Africa, a Democratic rethink of foreign policy, and what showbiz can teach drug companies]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/02/jihadism-in-africa-a-democratic-rethink-of-foreign-policy-and-what-showbiz-can-teach-drug-companies]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/editors_picks_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-02T17:15:24Z&quot;&gt;May 2nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A selection of three essential articles read aloud from the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;.
