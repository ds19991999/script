In front of the partition stood Marko, a 26-year-old student, ballot paper in hand. During the elections for the European Parliament, which took place between the 23rd and 26th of May, the studio doubled as a polling station. Marko had not voted in the previous poll in 2014. This time was different. “Right-wing parties are coming up,” he said, ignoring the dancers twirling behind him. “It’s really important to make my voice heard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was not the only voter feeling more motivated. Around 51% of eligible voters cast their ballots in this year’s European elections, up eight percentage points from five years ago. It was the first time turnout increased since direct elections to the European Parliament were instituted in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of decline, European voters are returning to the polling booths, for both national and European contests. The trend is uneven. Turnout fell in some countries, such as France and Italy, and flat in others. But it has increased in many states, shooting up by nine points in Spain’s general election last month, to levels not seen in two decades . Sweden’s last year saw the highest turnout since 1986. Voter participation in Dutch and German elections, both in 2017, climbed by seven and five points respectively. What might account for this turnaround?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_WOC980.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190601_WOC980.png 200w,

Populist parties, which rail against established elites, seem particularly adept at reaching people who do not normally vote. In Germany’s general election in 2017, a study by Infratest Dimap, a German polling agency, suggests that people who previously did not vote were the largest source of new votes for the Alternative for Germany, a Eurosceptic, anti-immigration party. Last weekend, it gained 10 seats in the European Parliament, with turnout across the country up by a quarter from 2014. Spikes in Dutch turnout, such as in the 2002 general election or last month’s provincial elections, have coincided with the formation of new far-right parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of right-wing populism is also boosting turnout among its opponents. Some leftist parties are explicitly using the threat from the far right as a rallying cry. “The boundary between going forward and going backwards...can be just one vote,” Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s Socialist prime minister, told voters before they went to the polls last month. It seems to be working. Like their Eurosceptic counterparts, strongly Europhile parties have gained seats in the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even beyond the far right, smaller parties are growing at the expense of larger established ones, which means voters now have more choices than before. The centre-right Ciudadanos and left-wing Podemos parties in Spain, both of which first gained seats at the national level in 2015, have become mainstays of political life. Eco-friendly Dutch voters can choose between GroenLinks and the more hardline Party for the Animals. Fatima, a teaching assistant at an Islamic school in Amsterdam, says she did not vote until DENK, a party geared towards Dutch Muslims, was founded in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing worries about climate change are probably also driving up political participation, especially among young voters. “I’m here to save the environment,” declares Pierre, a student in the German town of Duisburg, adding that he and many of his friends became politically aware by attending Fridays for Future protests, a series of weekly student strikes that have grown in recent months. Organisers say 320,000 people in Germany participated in them on May 24th. Green parties across Europe won a total of 69 seats last week, up by 19 from 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor in increasing turnout is social media. In many countries, Facebook reminds users when elections take place, sometimes offering links to websites that help people find polling stations. “On my way here, I saw a poster telling us to go and vote,” says Pierre. “Social media is like seeing that poster every day.” Even Grindr, a gay dating app, had an advertisement urging users to “vote for your future” in the European elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is high voter participation good for democracy? “High turnout is not necessarily evidence of civic health,” argues Peter Kellner, formerly of YouGov, a polling agency. “It can also be a sign of a divided society.” Tom van der Meer of the University of Amsterdam disagrees. Even though rising turnout is associated with greater political polarisation and fragmentation, he says, “democracy is fundamentally about inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，被墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;新增&lt;a href="https://feedx.net/needhelp" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;“帮你做个RSS”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 05:40:30 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A new anti-corruption law aims at foreign buyers of London’s posh homes]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/29/a-new-anti-corruption-law-aims-at-foreign-buyers-of-londons-posh-homes]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190601_brp503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-29T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 29th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUSPECTING THAT a fancy London pad was acquired with stolen money is one thing, proving it another. British crime-busters have long struggled to join the dots to courts’ satisfaction. So last year the country introduced Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs), which shift the burden of proof. These can be issued when there is a gap between the value of an asset and the legitimate income of the apparent owner—for instance a foreign official on a modest state salary or one of his relatives. The property can be frozen while police investigate, and seized if suspects subsequently fail to explain the source of their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emerged this week that three London homes have been frozen by the High Court, in the second use of such orders by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The properties, worth £80m ($101m) when purchased a decade ago, are held by offshore companies. The owner has not been named but is a “politically exposed person”—a politician, state official or someone linked to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first batch of UWOs were aimed at £22m-worth of property, including a house (see photo) in London’s Knightsbridge neighbourhood, belonging to Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of a jailed Azeri banker. This week details of £16m she spent in the Harrods store over a decade (using 54 credit cards) were laid bare. They included £3.5m on Boucheron jewellery, £160,000 at the perfume counters and £332,000 on Tom Dixon’s furniture and café offerings (mostly the former, presumably). Mrs Hajiyeva denies wrongdoing and is appealing against the possible loss of her homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government touts UWOs as evidence that it is taking on foreigners who launder ill-gotten gains through property purchases, often hiding behind shell companies. A public register of the owners of offshore firms that hold British property is in the works. (In 2016 Britain became the first G20 country to launch an open register of domestic firms’ owners.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many more such orders would be needed to reach beyond the tip of the money-laundering iceberg. Transparency International has identified 150 British properties worth £4.4bn bought with iffy wealth, and that is just the “low-hanging fruit”, says the anti-corruption group. The NCA complains of being underfunded, and resources have been diverted from white-collar cases to areas with more visible victims, such as knife crime. Ministers trumpet a new National Economic Crime Centre, attached to the NCA. “Deckchairs rearranged, with little new money,” scoffs a former senior prosecutor. UWOs are a useful tool, but Britain will also need to invest more in investigations if it is serious about driving out corrupt capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，被墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;新增&lt;a href="https://feedx.net/needhelp" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;“帮你做个RSS”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 03:41:40 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rash behaviour—behind the resurgence of measles]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/29/rash-behaviour-behind-the-resurgence-of-measles]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/babbage_1_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-29T18:15:02Z&quot;&gt;May 29th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE MEASLES &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/05/25/measles-is-often-spread-by-adults&quot;&gt;resurgence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; around the world has been blamed on parents refusing to vaccinate their children, but &lt;strong&gt;is vaccinating children enough?&lt;/strong&gt; Also, how a new glove for humans is &lt;strong&gt;teaching robots how to feel&lt;/strong&gt;.

These were not new astronomical objects, however. Rather, they were the first tranche of satellites for Starlink, a project intended to provide internet access across the globe, and they were launched into orbit on May 24th by SpaceX, an American rocketry firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing satellites from the ground with the naked eye is nothing new. But astronomers (professional and amateur) were surprised, and unhappy, at just how many and how bright the Starlink satellites appeared to be. Quite a few of them took to Twitter to raise the alarm and post pictures and videos of the blazing birds. Their worry was that these satellites and their successors could change the night sky for ever. If the initial 60 members of the Starlink network were already causing noticeable light pollution, they reasoned, how bad would it get once the full constellation of 12,000 had been launched?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who enjoy watching the night sky for pleasure it would surely be sad, for it would more than triple the number of man-made objects in the firmament and thus further degrade the natural beauty of the heavens—a beauty already diminished in many places by light pollution from the ground. For those involved in investigating the universe scientifically, though, it may be more than merely sad. In some cases it could be job-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary analysis shows, for example, that almost every image from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in Chile, currently nearing completion and intended to photograph the entire available sky every few nights when it is operational, could contain a satellite trail. These streaks can be removed, but each correction destroys valuable data. It is possible that some experiments, such as observing at regular intervals the variation in behaviour of astronomical objects, will no longer be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optical astronomers thus have cause to be nervous about Starlink. For radio astronomers its impact may be even more serious. The satellites’ mode of operation necessarily requires them to send radio signals back to Earth, all of which will be stronger than any signal arriving from deep space. This can be accomodated to a certain extent by knowing which frequencies the satellites are broadcasting on, and adjusting accordingly. But exactly how badly radio observatories are affected will depend on how well the satellites manage to confine their broadcasts within those frequencies, which remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, SpaceX’s boss, initially dismissed astronomers’ concerns, tweeting at the weekend that there were “already 4,900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ˜0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp;amp; will have ˜0% impact on advancements in astronomy.” In later exchanges, though, he struck a more understanding tone. Starlink would avoid the frequencies associated with radio astronomy, he said, and if the satellites’ orientations needed to be tweaked to minimise solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that could easily be done. Moreover, as the initial Starlink satellites moved into their operational configuration after the weekend, their brightness dropped—though they still occasionally flared as they crossed the sky, probably because of reflections from their large solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Musk also seemed, in his tweets, to suggest that the aims of Starlink outweighed the harms. “Potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.” His assertion has merit. The problem, as Mark McCaughrean, senior adviser for science and exploration at the European Space Agency, observes, is that there has been little public discussion of the matter. For Dr McCaughrean the night sky is a public commons that risks appropriation in the name of private interest. Whether that serves the greater good should at least be a matter of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, astronomers plan to carry out further simulations of the potential impacts of Starlink and other communication-satellite networks planned by companies such as OneWeb. But even when that work is complete, it is unclear what they can actually do to make SpaceX and its competitors listen to their concerns, for there is no legislation which regulates the impact of satellites on the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s Federal Communications Commission does concern itself with how satellites use the available radio spectrum and with what happens to them after they have done their job. But that is it. With the coming mega-constellations of communications satellites, it is surely time for this to change, and for governments (not only America’s) to involve themselves more deeply in the uses of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 01:40:31 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the trade war between China and America is changing global business]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/05/29/how-the-trade-war-between-china-and-america-is-changing-global-business]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190601_ldp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-29T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 29th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF YOU WANT to understand how cooling relations between America and China are changing global business, a good place to look is Alibaba, an internet giant. It is China’s most admired and valuable firm, worth a cool $400bn. For the past five years it has also been a hybrid that straddles the superpowers, because its shares are listed only in America. Now it is considering a $20bn flotation in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg. The backdrop is a rising risk of American retaliation against Chinese interests and the growing clout of Hong Kong’s capital markets. A listing there would be a sign that Chinese firms are taking out insurance to lower their dependence on Western finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world looked very different back in 2014, when Alibaba first went public. Although based in Hangzhou and with 91% of its sales from mainland China, it chose to list its shares in New York, home to the world’s deepest capital markets, which also permitted its complex voting structure. Wall Street banks underwrote the offering. Alibaba’s boss, Jack Ma, already a rock-star in China, was toasted in Manhattan high society as the kind of freewheeling capitalist Americans could do business with. He was not alone: 174 other Chinese firms have their main listing in America today, with a total market value of $394bn, including the tech stars Baidu and JD.com. A recent notable arrival is Luckin Coffee, a Starbucks wannabe, which floated for $4bn in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Alibaba has found, however, America has become less hospitable. The firm’s profits have soared and investors have made hay. But in January 2018 Ant Financial, its payments affiliate, was blocked from acquiring MoneyGram, an American rival, on national-security grounds. In November Mr Ma’s American halo slipped when it was revealed he was a Communist Party member, like many Chinese tycoons (he is due to retire this year). Silicon Valley’s chiefs whisper that Alibaba’s global cloud business is a threat to American interests. If Alibaba invests in startups it could fall foul of a new law, known as FIRRMA, that requires foreign purchases of “critical technology” to be vetted. The firm is not yet under attack, unlike its compatriot Huawei, but the mood is tense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade war between America and China has already spread from tariffs to a wide terrain encompassing legal extradition, venture capital and the global dollar-payments system. It is easy to see how an American listing could become a vulnerability. If, for example, China were to boycott Apple or Boeing, America could respond by suspending the trading of Chinese firms’ shares and stopping them from raising capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainland China’s vast but immature capital markets are not a substitute for Wall Street. Hong Kong, China’s offshore hub, is far from perfect, not least because China appears intent on gradually undermining the rule of law there. Still, it has become a plausible alternative venue for China’s global companies. It now welcomes firms with dual-share classes after a rule change in 2018. It has expanded its role as a conduit through which mainland investors can buy shares and global investors get access to China. Last year more money was raised in listings in Hong Kong ($37bn) than on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong’s rise has been accompanied by an erosion of Western hegemony in Asian high-finance. A decade ago Chinese banks were peripheral. Now Wall Street firms are not as essential as they used to be. Last year seven of the top 20 equity underwriters in Asia were Chinese firms. Chinese banks are among the largest cross-border lenders in Asia. America still controls the dollar-payments system, but in time that could change, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a Hong Kong listing, Alibaba would have an alternative place to raise capital. It is still expanding fast—sales grew by 51% last year. New York will continue to thrive as a financial centre, even if Chinese firms start to shy away. But the bigger message is that, as the trade war rumbles on, the immensely complex global network of financial and commercial ties is adjusting. Big hardware firms are tweaking their supply chains. Retailers are shifting their sourcing so that goods sold in America are not made in China. Banks are cutting their exposure to counterparties that could face American sanctions.

Paris Saint-Germain are untouchable in France, Bayern Munich have monopolised the Bundesliga, Juventus dominate in Italy and Barcelona have won 8 of La Liga’s past 11 titles. The only interesting prospects for fans on the continent as summer approaches are Europe’s two knockout competitions. But this year even those are highly predictable, in one sense at least: English clubs will win both. On June 1st Liverpool will play Tottenham in the Champions League final, three days after Arsenal face Chelsea in the Europa League (a secondary tournament for teams that miss out on the Champions League). Never before has one country produced all four finalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago English clubs dominated in Europe. At least one appeared in five consecutive Champions League finals from 2005 to 2009. In 2008 the country could boast the world’s four best teams, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://clubelo.com/2008-05-29/Ranking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ClubElo.com&lt;/a&gt;, a website which uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elo algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, originally devised for chess but now widely used in sports, to rank football clubs (see chart). However, the ensuing years were miserable for English clubs, who between them won the Champions League just once, as they tumbled down ClubElo’s rankings. None appeared in the top five in May 2017. “The puzzle”, this newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/britain/2017/09/02/the-english-are-bad-at-playing-football-but-brilliant-at-selling-it&quot;&gt;remarked&lt;/a&gt;, “is that the game’s most renowned domestic competition is not very good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the Premier League’s slump in quality coincided with a period of extraordinary revenue growth. In 2009 its earnings of €2.3bn ($2.6bn) were only €750m greater than the Bundesliga’s, Europe’s second-wealthiest division. By 2017 English clubs’ revenues had rocketed to €5bn, €2.2bn more than Germany’s. They acquired these riches by marketing themselves abroad zealously and sharing TV revenue more equally than other European teams, which made the Premier League more competitive, and therefore more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But English clubs squandered this wealth in the transfer market, by signing established stars rather than precocious youngsters from lesser teams. Some 15% of the Premier League’s transfers since 2016 have come from an elite group of the world’s top 14 clubs, according to 21st Club, a football consultancy, compared with an average of 9% for other major European leagues. Many of these purchases—such as Manchester United’s Alexis Sánchez, Chelsea’s Álvaro Morata and Arsenal’s Henrikh Mkhitaryan—have struggled to reproduce their previously stellar performances. European clubs also know that they can charge profligate English buyers higher fees. 21st Club calculates that Premier League clubs have spent 80% more than their foreign rivals for the same level of talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, three English teams have finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/05/12/how-manchester-city-came-to-rule-english-football&quot;&gt;seen the error of their ways&lt;/a&gt;. Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham have recently spent their transfer dosh on callow players from unfashionable teams—such as Kevin de Bruyne from Wolfsburg, Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim and Son Heung-min from Leverkusen—who have developed into world-beaters. ClubElo now ranks these three teams among Europe’s top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have been less shrewd in the transfer market. But they have still managed to haul themselves back into Europe’s top ten. If they can learn to use their fortunes as wisely as their Premier League rivals have done, then European fans can expect to see more all-English finals in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 01:40:29 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nigerians got poorer in Muhammadu Buhari’s first term]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/05/29/nigerians-got-poorer-in-muhammadu-buharis-first-term]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190601_map003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-29T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 29th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG LINES of lorries stretch like tentacles from Apapa port, the largest in Nigeria. Drivers doze in their cabs, feet flung over dashboards; some sling hammocks beneath the chassis. Musa Ibrahim, an ebullient trader, says he has been queuing for two days. He gestures at empty buildings. “Most of the companies you see here they done close,” he sighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian economy is stuck like a stranded truck. Average incomes have been falling for four years; the IMF thinks they will not rise for at least another six. The latest figures put unemployment at 23%, after growing for 15 consecutive quarters. Inflation is 11%. Some 94m people live on less than $1.90 a day, more than in any other country, and the number is swelling. By 2030 a quarter of very poor people will be Nigerian, predicts the World Data Lab, which counts such things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria’s engine was already sputtering when President Muhammadu Buhari took the wheel in 2015. The price of oil, which makes up 9% of GDP and more than 90% of export earnings, had crashed. But “Baba Go Slow”, as Nigerians took to calling him, made a bad situation worse. Instead of letting Nigeria’s currency slide, which would have stoked inflation, policymakers rationed dollars to maintain the naira’s long-standing and artificially high peg to the dollar. To do so the central bank refused to release foreign currency for a long list of imports, ranging from toothpicks to shovels. Without dollars for equipment or supplies, factories closed and workers were laid off, leading to a recession in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central bank confused things further by introducing several exchange rates. One was an official rate of 305 naira per dollar. Its main use seemed to be to allow the bank to brag about how strong the currency was since it sold almost no dollars at that absurd rate. Its second rate was used to funnel artificially cheap dollars (about 320 naira each) to favoured importers. Naturally, there were not enough of these dollars to go around, so most Nigerians (especially those buying toothpicks) had to pay as much as 500 naira on the black market. The gap between most of these rates has converged of late at about 360. But having so many rates puts off investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government thinks the answer to the “dollar shortage” is for Nigerians to make and grow more and import less (see next article). To this end, it has slapped import taxes on rice and fertilizer and is giving tax breaks for a huge new oil refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little sign of the kind of export-led industrial revolution that has lifted incomes in Asia. This is not only because the naira is overvalued. It is also because the state has spent decades neglecting basic public goods, like roads, schools and electricity. “In Nigeria if you set up a business you have to build your infrastructure, you have to build your power plant, you have to build everything,” says Abdul Samad Rabiu, the chairman of the BUA Group, a conglomerate. Eghosa Omoigui, who manages a tech fund, compares running a business there to “running a nation state”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where urgency is needed, Mr Buhari offers only caution. Few are holding their breath for any more drive in his second term, which began on May 29th. “We are trying to avoid shocks,” explains Adeyemi Dipeolu, his economic adviser: sharp currency movements or hikes in electricity tariffs would be felt by ordinary Nigerians. Yet officials are postponing a crisis, not averting one. Consider borrowing. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 28%. But Nigeria collects so little in tax that interest payments swallow about 60% of federal revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a debt problem, we have a revenue problem,” insists Udoma Udo Udoma, budget minister in Mr Buhari’s first term. The government plans to raise funds by selling off some of its share in joint-venture contracts with oil companies and might hike taxes on luxury goods. Revenues are rising, but fall far short of budget targets. Some of the gap is probably being filled by running up an overdraft with the central bank, which now holds more assets than the entire banking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public finances would be healthier if the government raised the price of fuel, which is imported by the state oil company and sold on at a loss. Last year this subsidy was worth at least 0.5% of GDP—as much as the government spent on health care. Politicians are scared to end the subsidy. An attempt to do so in 2012 led to massive protests. Although the government has expanded school-feeding programmes and is working on a safety net for the poor, most citizens get few benefits from the state. Oxfam, a charity, ranks 157 countries on their commitment to reducing inequality, based on social spending, taxes and labour laws: Nigeria comes last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Nigeria to prosper, the state could harness the vim of its 200m citizens. Instead it ignores them, except when politicians need votes. People have come to expect nothing from government, says Chika Okeke, who owns a small stationery shop in Lagos: “you struggle yourself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 01:40:27 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to read the Supreme Court’s latest ruling on abortion rights]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/05/29/how-to-read-the-supreme-courts-latest-ruling-on-abortion-rights]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_USP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-29T14:30:20Z&quot;&gt;May 29th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN 2016, Donald Trump said &lt;em&gt;Roe v Wade,&lt;/em&gt; the 1973 abortion-rights ruling, would “automatically” be overruled by justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court. Three years later, with two of his picks in robes and a surge of challenges to &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; flying to the court, abortion-rights supporters fear Mr Trump’s prediction may be close to coming true. But, so far, every time a reckoning on &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; seems imminent, the Supreme Court has taken a step back. Abortion rights are in trouble, but it seems that the conservative justices on the nation’s highest court (with the notable exception of Clarence Thomas) are content to plod along rather than rush headlong into a decision that could spark a dangerous new flashpoint in the culture wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While states like Georgia and Alabama have been passing alarmingly extreme abortion bans that are flatly out-of-line with &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;, the Supreme Court has been considering whether to take &lt;em&gt;Box v Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky,&lt;/em&gt; a case involving a more insidious type of anti-abortion law. &lt;em&gt;Box&lt;/em&gt; concerns HEA 1337, which Mike Pence, now the vice-president, signed into law in 2016 when he was governor of Indiana. In a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://casetext.com/case/planned-parenthood-ind-ky-inc-v-commr-of-the-ind-state-dept-of-health&quot;&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; last year, two of the law’s provisions were deemed unconstitutional: a requirement that fetal remains from abortions be buried or cremated; and a bar on abortions motivated solely by the fetus’s race, sex or diagnosed disability such as Down syndrome. The fetal-remains provision lacks a rational basis, the Seventh Circuit held, while the “non-discrimination” rule undermines &lt;em&gt;Roe’s&lt;/em&gt; promise, reaffirmed in 1992 in &lt;em&gt;Planned Parenthood v Casey,&lt;/em&gt; that states may place no “undue burden” on a woman’s right to end a pregnancy prior to viability, or about 24 weeks’ gestation. To prohibit women with particular motivations from aborting their fetuses is to impose “far greater than a substantial obstacle” on the constitutional right, the Seventh Circuit ruled. These limits are “absolute prohibitions on abortions prior to viability which the Supreme Court has clearly held cannot be imposed by the state”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The justices decide which cases they will decide, and they can take as long as they like to “grant” or “deny” a so-called “petition for certiorari”. &lt;em&gt;Box&lt;/em&gt; had been on the justices’ conference table since early January, and they have mulled over how to handle it at 14 private conferences. Finally, on May 28th, the court issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://casetext.com/case/box-v-planned-parenthood-of-indiana-and-kentucky-inc&quot;&gt;curious ruling&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Box&lt;/em&gt;. First, by a vote of 7-2, the justices reversed the Seventh Circuit on the fetal-remains question. Under the deferential standard employed at the appeals court, the justices noted in an unsigned opinion, states may regulate how aborted fetal tissue is disposed of. (The ruling left open whether the provision might fail the “undue burden” test from &lt;em&gt;Casey&lt;/em&gt;, since it wasn’t litigated that way.) Second, by a 9-0 vote, the court declined to weigh in on the discrimination claim. Without saying a word on the controversy over aborting fetuses diagnosed with Down syndrome, the court simply observed that “[o]nly the Seventh Circuit has thus far addressed this kind of law” and pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://supreme.findlaw.com/supreme_court/rules/part3.html&quot;&gt;Rule 10&lt;/a&gt;, according to which the justices generally stay on the sidelines when a legal issue has not “been considered by additional courts of appeals”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brief 650-word opinion contrasts sharply with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/box-v-planned-parenthood-of-indiana-and-kentucky-inc/&quot;&gt;hundreds of pages of briefs&lt;/a&gt; from pro-life organisations and religious groups urging the Supreme Court to save both parts of Indiana’s law. The surgical side-step, coming after months of deliberation, bears the fingerprints of Chief Justice John Roberts, the new median justice on a right-tilting court. Though Chief Justice Roberts worked against &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s Justice Department and has voted to chip away at abortion rights, he has become keener to steer the court away from treacherous waters. With a baldly political light cast on the court in the Trump era—especially during last autumn’s explosive confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh—the chief seems increasingly circumspect. He is loth to take on a controversy that would spring a 5-4 abortion decision on America just weeks before the parties’ national conventions in the summer of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chief Justice Roberts did not construct this compromise by himself. On the left, he persuaded Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer to uphold the fetal-remains law—apparently by demurring on whether it might fail under a different litigation strategy. (Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg would have left in place the lower-court ruling against fetal-tissue rule.) On the right, the chief convinced his fellow conservatives to hold their fire on the Down syndrome provision. Justice Samuel Alito and Mr Trump’s two picks (Justices Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch) joined the per-curiam silently. Only Justice Clarence Thomas would not be restrained, penning a 20-page tirade associating women who choose to end their pregnancies with the eugenics movement of the 20th-century. Abortion is “rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation”, he wrote, and prenatal tests giving women information about fetal abnormalities add fuel to a moral travesty. The only reason Justice Thomas cited for not voting to take up Indiana’s appeal—and allowing the Down-syndrome provision to take effect—was the matter of Supreme Court procedure. “[F]urther percolation” in the lower courts, he wrote, “may assist our review of this issue”. That review, he hastened to note, should take place “soon”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewed alongside the court’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/02/08/the-supreme-court-blocks-abortion-clinic-regulations-in-louisiana&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; in February to let anti-abortion clinic regulations go into effect in Louisiana—a move that surprised many observers—this court’s Solomonic ruling in &lt;em&gt;Box&lt;/em&gt; signals a Supreme Court that is in no hurry to entertain serious challenges to &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; while a presidential campaign is underway. But abortion rights face a highly uncertain future in the hands of the justices in the medium term, and with prospects of another Supreme Court appointment for Mr Trump in the coming years, the pace toward a post-&lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; reality could pick up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2019 22:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Can think-tanks survive a post-fact world?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/05/29/can-think-tanks-survive-a-post-fact-world]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_OPP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-29T14:30:00Z&quot;&gt;May 29th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HUNDRED years ago this week, diplomats and academics from the British and American delegations at the Versailles peace conference at the end of the first world war met for a dinner at the Hotel Majestic in Paris, a short stroll from the Arc de Triomphe. Their aim was to work out how to continue their fruitful co-operation beyond the peace talks and promote internationalist values in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their initial idea for a single Anglo-American institute to fuse a weakened Britain and an ascendant America was not realised. But the dinner on May 30th 1919 gave rise to two institutions that have shaped public outlook and public policy on foreign affairs ever since: the Royal Institute for International Affairs (known as Chatham House, after the building in which it resides), set up in London in 1920, and the Council on Foreign Relations, founded the following year in New York. They have served as templates for numerous other think-tanks around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as the two organisations prepare to celebrate their centenaries, the festivities are tinged with anxiety. For how can institutions founded to pursue non-partisan, evidence-based research, carried out by experts, survive in an era when facts do not seem to matter quite so much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, people have had “enough of experts”, in the words of Michael Gove, a senior Tory politician in Britain. President Donald Trump positively boasts of trusting his gut “more than anybody else’s brain”. Many of the West’s elected leaders have explicitly rejected the entire rationale for the sort of serious-mined wonkery that used to earn think-tanks influence, status and, most importantly, donors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their main customers—politicians and legislators—more eager to probe their digestive tracts rather than scour policy pamphlets for ideas, one might wonder whether think-tanks have had their day. Could they too go the way of five-year plans, Britain’s National Coal Board and Betamax?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the quest for fresh political ideas predate modern think-tanks—be it colonial America&amp;#x27;s pamphleteers or Britain&amp;#x27;s Fabian Society, founded in 1884—they served a vital function in the 20th century by presenting government officials with thoughtful analysis and policy options that were more immediate and relevant than from academia (but ideally held to the same standard and often by practitioners holding the same qualifications). This was the era of think-tanks, from private meetings at Chatham House to plan for reconstruction following the second world war, to Paul Baran at RAND conjuring up the idea for a data-network that became the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The think-tank industry expanded rapidly, responding to an almost insatiable demand for bright ideas and practical policy proposals. Most of these were devoted to domestic and economic policy rather than foreign affairs. American and British think-tanks were often in lockstep at the forefront of ideological churn, from Keynesianism to Thatcherism/Reaganism in the 1980s, through to Blairism, the “third way” and Bill Clinton’s “New Democrat” era in the 1990s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of the influence of the Institute of Economic Affairs on Mrs Thatcher, or the links between the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute and the Reagan administrations. A political generation later, Demos and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) contributed to the creation of Tony Blair’s New Labour. The Progressive Policy Institute provided the intellectual blueprints for Bill Clinton’s centrist agenda. The Brookings Institution, the Carnegie Endowment, the Aspen Institute and others were never too far away. Think-tanks not only contributed ideas, but also people; presidential and prime ministerial staffs were stuffed with their bright young wonks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as a class, the thinkocracy was caught out badly by the phenomena of Trump and Brexit. In neither case did it contribute much to these movements, nor did it see them coming. Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, has donned the hair-shirt. In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/94/6/1409/5162428?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; last November, he noted that “Western think-tanks evolved principally into supporters and managers of globalisation […] focusing excessively, or indeed exclusively, on the net gains […] and insufficiently, or indeed not at all, on the local dislocation and widening economic and social inequality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, the insurgency against the European Union, against immigration, against London and the south-east, against globalisation—all exposed by the Leave campaign’s victory in the Brexit referendum in 2016—largely by-passed London’s thinkocrats. In America, the policy jocks missed similar signs of anger on both the right and the left, whether the issue was the culture wars or the economy. The think-tanks thus failed in one of their primary functions: to analyse and clarify the main trends of the day, and consequently to advocate relevant policies. Accustomed to making the weather, think-tanks were victims of an intellectual storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, much of the new thinking (or gut-gazing) of men like Steve Bannon and Nigel Farage evolved specifically in opposition to what they perceived to be an out-of-touch elite of pointyheads and political careerists—exemplified (for them) by bodies such as Chatham House and the Council on Foreign Relations. In as far as Mr Trump has any use for advisers dealing in evidence-based arguments, it is, as one of those advisers, Cliff Sims, recalls of his time in the White House, to “provide the underlying analytics that confirm his intuition”. The concept of “objective truth” has broken down, especially in America—and this is exactly what think-tanks have traditionally aspired to enunciate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this is symptomatic of a rising distrust of experts and professionals more generally. The loss of confidence in professions such as politics and journalism is well advertised. But in America, for instance, this has extended to all institutions associated with learning and knowledge. In 1974 the average confidence level for these institutions peaked at about 50%, yet by 2012 it had declined to just 31%. In Britain, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/02/17/leave-voters-are-less-likely-trust-any-experts-eve&quot;&gt;YouGov&lt;/a&gt;, a polling organisation, in 2017 just 25% of respondents trusted economists—the backbone of many think-tanks—while 44% distrusted them. Only politicians were more distrusted. Think-tanks are equally on the receiving end of the new scepticism in Britain. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://weareflint.co.uk/forging-the-think-tank-narrative-uk&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; last year only 17% of respondents trusted what think-tanks had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are rising. The anti-fact populists are muscling up for a fight. Mr Bannon and others have leased a 13th-century monastery outside Rome to serve, in his words, as a right-wing “gladiator school for cultural warriors”. Mr Bannon wants it to be a counterweight to the Open Society Foundation backed by George Soros, a liberal-minded investor and philanthropist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can think-tanks survive in this setting? They could wait it out, of course. All the polling suggests that deepening political partisanship in both American and Britain accounts for some of this distrust in expertise. That is, Republicans are far more likely to be sceptical of evidence-based research and scientific methods than Democrats, just as Brexiteers are more sceptical of authority than Remainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one academic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tkpn5/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of contemporary American politics concludes: “For the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal, it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political system as flawed or illegitimate”. The centre may yet regroup, provoking a renewed faith in objective facts. But that is to bet on the Trump era not being part of a long-term secular trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More to the point, think-tanks should help themselves. The first place to start is with trust. To an extent, people are right to be sceptical of the institutions’ claims to objectivity. Many of them have a long way to go in terms of openness and transparency. And far from being engrossed in the noble pursuit of truth and reason, some of the beltway think-tanks have begun to look more like brainy guns for hire, prepared to shoot off whatever argument a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html&quot;&gt;country&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/us/politics/think-tanks-research-and-corporate-lobbying.html&quot;&gt;corporation&lt;/a&gt; gives them—a situation exposed by the New York Times. Brookings and the Center for Strategic and International Studies have come under particular scrutiny. The think-tanks need to be vigilant that they’re not simply selling their brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, think-tanks must get outside the bubbles of London, Washington, DC or New York and have a broader reach, both in terms of input and output. IPPR, for one, set up a well-respected branch in the north of England with offices in Manchester and Newcastle. Meanwhile, Chatham House has been expanding its London headquarters. As for CFR, it holds an annual “national” meeting in New York: its membership might learn more about the forces shaping American politics if the location were changed to Youngstown, Ohio—emblematic of a small city’s factory closures, crime and disgruntlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, think-tanks must not abandon their strengths, of reason and empirical analysis, but they need to draw from wider sources of knowledge and experience and then communicate their research to a wider audience. They means doing more to involve ethnic minorities, young people, people of different political persuasions and, most of all, fully-blown mavericks. Some of the thinkers who Mrs Thatcher deployed so successfully in her think-tanks were barely house-trained, but they certainly had plenty of attitude and iconoclasm, precisely what is needed to think the unthinkable. Sir Alfred Sherman, for one, had fought for the communists in the Spanish civil war; a journalist, he enjoyed nothing better than riling the bien pensants. Think-tanks can survive in a post-fact universe not by marshalling more facts but by showing more verve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years after the meeting that gave birth to Chatham House and the CFR, the Hotel Majestic was the setting for another get-together: the so-called “dinner party of the century”.
