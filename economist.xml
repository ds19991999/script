That is the widely held perception of the continental divide in business culture. But it has not always been the case; 40 years ago, there was precious little difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new book, “Spending Time: The Most Valuable Resource”, Daniel Hamermesh, an economist, examines how work and leisure patterns in America differ from those in the rest of the developed world. In the first half of the 20th century the American working week fell sharply from nearly 60 hours to around 40. By 1979 the average worker in America put in around 38.2 hours a week, similar to the number in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is where the figures started to diverge. For a while, the American workweek got longer, reaching 39.4 hours in 2000, before falling back to 38.6 in 2016. The main difference, however, is holidays. In the 1980s Europeans began to take more annual leave but Americans did not. Over the year as a whole, Americans average 34 hours a week, six more than the French and eight more than the Germans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What explains this gap? Some point to cultural reasons but, as Mr Hamermesh points out, it is hard to see why American culture suddenly diverged from that of the rest of the world in the last 40 years. Others point to lower taxes, which raise the value of putting in the extra hour. Yet American taxes were lower than European rates back in the 1960s, when working hours were similar. Another potential explanation is a decline in trade union membership has weakened American workers’ bargaining power—except that unionisation rates in France and America are not far apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more plausible reason is policy. There is no legal requirement to offer paid vacations in America, whereas France mandates a minimum of 25 days, and Germany, 24. Famously, France also limits the working week to 35 hours. Mr Hamermesh finds similar examples in Asia. In the 1980s and 1990s, Japan passed laws reducing the standard working week from 48 hours to 40. Beyond that, workers were entitled to overtime pay. A similar process occurred in South Korea between 2004 and 2008. Employers responded by cutting hours; workers earned less as a result but surveys found they were happier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In America, by contrast, champions of workers’ rights have recently focused on raising the minimum wage (so far to little avail at the federal level, though some states have enacted more generous wage floors). Wage gains have certainly skewed toward the better-off. The median American worker makes about $20 an hour while the worker at the 95th percentile makes $62. That is a ratio of 3.1. Back in 1979, the ratio was 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These higher wages do seem to have had an incentive effect. High-paid employees work 8-9 more hours a week than the lowest-paid. In part, this may reflect the low earnings of part-time workers, who have grown as a share of the workforce. Either way, the gap has widened since the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t shed too may tears for the wealthy. They may work more hours, but the poor often work more inconvenient ones. It is a myth to say that well-paid workers put in more hours at the weekends or at night, Mr Hamermesh says. It is cleaners and food delivery people who work when it is dark, not bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is going on? John Maynard Keynes dreamed that his grandchildren would be working only 15 hours a week. But the decline in hours which the economist predicted slowed after the 1970s. This may hint that 35-40 hours is close to the most efficient working period. Any more and workers become too stressed; any less and companies lose too much production. But it is also a sign that Keynes was wrong to think that society would place a high value on extra leisure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the developed world most workers have more than enough to feed themselves and their families. But they still want &amp;quot;positional&amp;quot; goods—homes in a good location, holidays in sun-drenched resorts and possessions that demonstrate their social status. Prices of these goods will be pushed higher, driving status-seeking employees to work more hours to earn them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So whatever labour-saving gadgets Silicon Valley dreams up, future generations will probably still have to put in a long shift. But Americans could enjoy a bit more holiday. Those who feel the same ought to ask their politicians why Europeans should get more rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 20:17:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ebola response in Congo is running short of money]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/06/23/the-ebola-response-in-congo-is-running-short-of-money]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190622_map504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-23T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 23rd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINCE LAST August, when the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has published regular reports that make for grim reading. With 2,204 cases and 1,479 deaths as of June 19th, this is the second-largest outbreak of Ebola in history. The failure to eliminate Ebola has been complicated by conflict, politics and the weakness of the country’s health system. Money should not be an issue in this sort of internationally led emergency response. Yet it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, if the Ebola outbreak gets out of control, it will quickly become a multi-billion dollar headache for the world, just as it did in West Africa. But the WHO’s resources are stretched thin for its response in Congo. Since February, it has received donations for less than half of the money it has needed to fight the outbreak, and has now all but used up an emergency fund. The WHO warns that operations could grind to a halt during a critical stage of the outbreak. Member states are being urged to meet the funding gap in order to prevent the response from suffering a “potentially devastating setback”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, the projected costs until July were $98m. Of this, the WHO has received from donors only $44m. To stay solvent, the WHO has dipped into a pot of money called the contingency fund for emergencies, or CFE. Since the beginning of the outbreak, it has taken about $73m from the kitty. The CFE is supposed to be there to release money quickly, during a sudden emergency, for example when plague struck Madagascar. It has been used 44 times in the past year. This fast-moving pot of cash can be mobilised in as little as 24 hours and can be critical in life-threatening situations. But the CFE is now “running on fumes” says one spokesperson and is down to less than $4m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO says it will have to scour its reserves to see if more money can be found. But the scale of the shortfall means that for its next planning period, which starts in July, the WHO may have to restrict its operations. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies, is reluctant to say the organisation will cut any of its core funding for Ebola. This seems to mean that the WHO will, somehow, find the money for the most mission-critical aspects of the response. However, Mr Ryan also concedes that money has become an “obstacle” to completing the job of eradicating Ebola. Either way, the organisation is clearly facing a challenge finding enough cash. Mr Ryan says the WHO is constantly reprioritising, moving money around, “sometimes robbing Peter to pay Paul”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, pressure has mounted on the WHO to declare an official health emergency in Congo. Some, such as Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, a charity that supports international health, feel that declaring what is known as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) would raise awareness about the outbreak and with it more international funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declaring a PHEIC is, strictly speaking, a technical designation that commits the WHO to issuing formal recommendations to countries on how to handle the outbreak. However, declaring a PHEIC does focus attention and might have been expected to help drum up extra money. But the WHO feels that there is moral hazard in declaring an emergency simply to raise money. It also weakens the argument for having money available to deal with outbreaks, so that there is no need to call a PHEIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is sufficiently serious that Britain’s international development secretary, Rory Stewart, is planning a number of trips in the next few weeks to persuade other donors among the G7 to stump up more cash as soon as possible. He may also want to raise the issue of the funding gap for preparing neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is vital work. According to Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the WHO, health workers have been trained in infection control, the use of protective gear and creating isolation facilities. Seth Berkley, boss of Gavi, an international vaccine finance agency that has been helping to provide Ebola vaccine, says that close to 5,000 health workers have been vaccinated in 165 facilities in Uganda. Workers in South Sudan and Rwanda have also been jabbed. Already, three cases of Ebola have been confirmed in Uganda. More efforts will be needed to prevent a crisis in one country from becoming a regional disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 20:17:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mark Esper looks set to be America’s next defence secretary]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/06/22/mark-esper-looks-set-to-be-americas-next-defence-secretary]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190629_blp901.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-22T06:20:14Z&quot;&gt;Jun 22nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE circumstances, President Donald Trump’s announcement on the evening of June 21st that he intended to nominate Mark Esper to be his defence secretary was as good as could be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Esper, the current army secretary, would not be a distinguished occupant of the office held by Robert McNamara and Robert Gates. Aside from some odd jobs as a congressional staffer and in the Pentagon, the 55-year-old is best known as a successful former defence industry lobbyist. He has no significant foreign policy experience. Yet he has some credentials lacked by Patrick Shanahan, the acting secretary who will shortly leave the Pentagon: including a decade of active duty service in the army and influential admirers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Trump had previously announced his intention to nominate Mr Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, to become secretary permanently. Yet he refrained from doing so, as doubts about Mr Shanahan mounted. Though accommodating to the president (including in his support for siphoning billions off his own department’s budget in order to pay for some border fencing) he made no significant mark on the government during six months as acting successor to James Mattis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a relative non-entity in security discussions on Iran, North Korea and elsewhere, even as Mr Trump contemplated launching military strikes on the former. He resigned from the government this week after the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; revealed serious incidents of domestic violence in Mr Shanahan’s family (His son beat up his ex-wife with a baseball bat). He was to be replaced, on the same acting basis, by Mr Esper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will now complicate Mr Esper’s nomination. He cannot go through a Senate confirmation process for a job he is holding temporarily. He is therefore expected to be replaced as acting secretary of defence by the navy secretary, Richard Spencer. That would mean Mr Trump is set to have four defence secretaries in three years, a record rate of turnover. The administration’s current length of time without a defence secretary, over six months, is another record. (It also has no ambassador to the United Nations or secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, among other security-related jobs). Yet Mr Esper does at least look able to secure Senate confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was confirmed as army secretary by the Senate with a large majority and has admirers there, including Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Whether Mr Esper could restore the primacy that the Pentagon, the federal government’s biggest department, has traditionally enjoyed in security decision-making is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Mr Mattis resigned, in protest at Mr Trump, the Pentagon has been increasingly sidelined by the National Security Council, under John Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr Trump was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/06/21/donald-trump-orders-air-strikes-on-iran-then-cancels-them&quot;&gt;briefly persuaded&lt;/a&gt; to order an air strike on Iran under their belligerent guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Mr Esper graduated from West Point in the same class as Mr Pompeo suggests he might have a firm ally in the secretary of state. He might in that case also be expected to support him in Mr Pompeo’s emerging rivalry with Mr Bolton. Given the national security adviser’s particularly extreme bellicosity, that would probably be for the best. Yet the notion that the secretary of defence could play such as secondary role in cabinet politics is also indicative of how far the Pentagon has fallen in the pecking order since Mr Mattis left it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 18:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Which Democrats can challenge Trump in 2020?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/21/which-democrats-can-challenge-donald-trump]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190622_blp509.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-21T17:07:04Z&quot;&gt;Jun 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANNE MCELVOY and John Prideaux, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s US editor, interview two distinctive hopefuls &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/06/20/donald-trump-launches-a-familiar-sounding-re-election-campaign&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;running to replace Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Pete Buttigieg&lt;/strong&gt;, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, assesses America’s role in the world and sets out his plan to redress racial inequality.

It was expected to launch the 797, a new mid-sized jet to fill the gap in its range between its smaller 737 narrow-body airliner and its much larger 787 and 777 wide-body jets. But instead it was Airbus, its European arch-rival, that launched a plane that fitted this criteria. The A321XLR (the XLR stands for “extra long range”) is a version of the planemaker’s popular narrow-body adapted to boost its range to 5,400 miles (8,700 km). This is made possible by enlarging the aircraft’s centre fuel tank. It is a move that could spell trouble for Boeing’s own plans to fill the middle of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The A321XLR is a plane “that is of interest to the entire world,” says Francois Caudron, a marketing boss at Airbus. He says the demand for the proposed jet came from airlines flying previous A321 models, which had a range of about 4,000 miles. “The market, asked us, ‘With the A321 now, we can fly from the East Coast of the United States into Europe, but we can’t really go deep into Europe. We can’t go to Rome. So Airbus, can you do something to give us another 500 nautical miles?’” The company responded, he says, with a new fuel tank configuration that added an extra 700 nautical miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boeing had hoped to answer that same question with its proposed Boeing 797. The American firm had hoped that it would serve as a replacement for the Boeing 757 and 767, two older mid-sized jets. But Mr Caudron says that Airbus also sees the new model as a replacement for Boeing’s 757. Both are narrow-body jets and they offer the same range and similar seating capacities. The XLR also burns 30% less fuel than the 757. Boeing’s proposed New Midsize Airplane (NMA) is instead a wide-body aircraft with two instead of one aisle. It has a slightly larger seating capacity and has more range than the XLR. So it seems much more like a replacement for the Boeing 767 in terms of size and design. All the extra space would certainly make it a more comfortable plane than the XLR for flyers. But it would also be more costly plane to fly, as the wider fuselage increases the amount of drag on the plane. And as passengers increasingly choose the cheapest tickets whatever the service on board an airline is like, that could harm sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much has been made of Boeing’s other troubles for the postponement of the 797’s launch. It is true that the continued grounding of its 737 MAX planes, due to safety worried following two crashes of the type in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people, does not help. But even before the 737 MAX’s problems, the business case for the 797 was already weak. Analysts have long said that the business plan only made sense if the profits from aftermarket services, such as maintenance checks and spare parts, were enough to make up the losses produced by designing and building the planes. With the XLR eating into the bottom of that market, it has become weaker still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 06:40:29 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The justices side with a death-row inmate over race and juries]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/06/21/a-prosecutor-excluded-black-jurors-from-a-murder-trial]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190622_USP507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-21T22:17:02Z&quot;&gt;Jun 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN 1986, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in &lt;em&gt;Batson v Kentucky&lt;/em&gt; that racial bias in jury selection violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. A lawyer cannot strike a potential juror from a case without a &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; reason, &lt;em&gt;Batson&lt;/em&gt; held, and defendants who suspect racial bias may raise an objection. More than three decades later, on June 21st, the justices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-9572_k536.pdf&quot;&gt;again split 7-2&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Flowers v Mississippi,&lt;/em&gt; a case involving a prosecutor who consistently excluded black prospective jurors from the six murder trials of Curtis Flowers, a black Mississippian. Mr Flowers was charged following the murder of four furniture-store employees in 1996. He was charged with each individual murder in the first four trials and for all four deaths in the fifth and sixth trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority opinion in &lt;em&gt;Flowers&lt;/em&gt;, penned by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, stretched to 31 pages but, as it said, broke “no new legal ground”. The ruling “simply enforce[s] and reinforce[s] &lt;em&gt;Batson&lt;/em&gt; by applying it to the extraordinary facts of this case”. The facts are, indeed, striking. In the six trials, Doug Evans, the prosecutor, used peremptory challenges (for which a lawyer need offer no reason, as opposed to a strike &amp;quot;for cause&amp;quot; that does cite a justification) to eliminate 41 of the 42 black prospective jurors. In the sixth trial, the one at issue in &lt;em&gt;Flowers&lt;/em&gt;, he excluded five of six. In the apparent hope of finding “pretexual reasons to strike” them, Justice Kavanaugh wrote, Mr Evans “engaged in dramatically disparate questioning of black and white prospective jurors”. And he excluded one black potential juror, Carolyn Wright, for reasons that should have resulted in a challenge to white jurors for whom the only relevant difference seemed to be their race. Prosecutors said Ms Wright was struck because she knew a few witnesses and worked at the same WalMart as Mr Flowers&amp;#x27;s father. But several white potential jurors were also familiar with players in the trial and faced less questioning and no challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first three trials, the Mississippi Supreme Court chastised Mr Evans for violating Mr Flowers’s right to an impartial jury and reversed the convictions. The fourth and fifth trials ended in hung juries, with no verdict. But Mississippi’s high court found no problem with Mr Evans’ behaviour the sixth time. In the latest trial, there were 26 potential jurors, six black and 20 white. The prosecution used five of its six peremptory strikes against black prospective jurors, resulting in 11 white jurors and one black juror. When Mr Flowers raised a challenge to the fairness of his trial under &lt;em&gt;Batson&lt;/em&gt;, the Mississippi Supreme Court rejected it. The United States Supreme Court then told the state court to take another look at the matter in light of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/05/24/the-supreme-court-cracks-down-on-racist-prosecutors&quot;&gt;its 2016 decision&lt;/a&gt; in&lt;em&gt; Foster v Chatman, &lt;/em&gt;another jury-discrimination decision. After a second examination, the Mississippi Supreme Court again sided with the prosecution. But the vote was 5-4, and a dissenting judge said he believed the majority had badly erred. “I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial”, he wrote.The five-judge majority “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of prospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory selection process”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After walking through the justification and implications of &lt;em&gt;Batson&lt;/em&gt; and the facts of Mr Flowers’s case, Justice Kavanaugh concluded the four dissenting judges on the Mississippi Supreme Court had it right. The state’s case against Mr Flowers was “motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent”. “Equal justice under law”—the words carved into marble above the familiar pillars of the Supreme Court’s main entrance—”requires a criminal trial free of racial discrimination in the jury selection process”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Kavanaugh’s thorough opinion attracted the votes of Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal-leaning justices. Justice Samuel Alito joined the judgment but wrote separately to emphasise that &lt;em&gt;Flowers&lt;/em&gt; is “a highly unusual case” and “likely one of a kind”. If not for the “unique combinations of circumstances present here”, Justice Alito would have affirmed the Mississippi Supreme Court’s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch did not find any circumstances worthy of vindicating Mr Flowers’s constitutional rights. In a biting 42-page dissent, Justice Thomas recounted the 1996 killings in detail and blamed his seven colleagues for “needlessly prolong[ing] the suffering of four victims’ families” and disrespecting Mississippi’s state courts. (The majority may have sided with Mr Flowers, the dissent speculates, to “boost its self-esteem”.) Looking through the record, Justice Thomas finds no evidence of racist prosecutorial intent. “Any competent prosecutor would have exercised the same strikes as the state did in this trial”, he wrote.

In 2016, according to America’s Energy Information Administration, the waterway carried some 19m barrels of crude and other petroleum products a day. Were it to be blocked, the world’s supply of oil would fall, and prices would spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of such an event is growing, and oil prices are rising as a result. In May last year, President Donald Trump pulled out of a nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed crippling sanctions on the country. Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, responded by threatening to block oil shipments; if Iran could not export oil, nor could others. Tensions have escalated further in recent days. On June 13th two ships were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. On June 20th an American surveillance drone flying over the strait was shot down by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. After tweeting that “Iran made a very big mistake!”, Mr Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/06/21/donald-trump-orders-air-strikes-on-iran-then-cancels-them&quot;&gt;reportedly ordered&lt;/a&gt; military strikes on Iran—only to change his mind hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One interpretation of the recent attacks on ships—if they were carried out by Iran, as America claims—is that they are intended to signal Iran’s readiness to act on its threat to block the waterway. The country could try to block the strait using speed boats, anti-ship missiles and mines. But doing so would probably be a desperate act of last resort. Iran would be risking a war with America and its regional allies. And military analysts think that America’s Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, would be able to re-open the waterway within weeks. In the meantime, at least some of the oil from Saudi Arabia and the UAE could be rerouted via pipelines away from the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 05:40:33 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Which Democrats can challenge Trump in 2020?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/21/which-democrats-can-challenge-trump-in-2020]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190622_blp509.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-21T17:07:04Z&quot;&gt;Jun 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANNE MCELVOY and John Prideaux, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s US editor, interview two distinctive hopefuls &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/06/20/donald-trump-launches-a-familiar-sounding-re-election-campaign&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;running to replace Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Pete Buttigieg&lt;/strong&gt;, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, assesses America’s role in the world and sets out his plan to redress racial inequality.

Those on the left are believed to be in favour of big government—high social spending, generous welfare and an ambitious regulatory scope—and those on the right opposed. This view is not entirely accurate. According to a new study of voter attitudes in 2019, Republicans are more positive about state intervention than conventional wisdom suggests, but the party is divided. Lower-income Republicans have much more progressive attitudes on economics than wealthy members of their party. This should enable enterprising Democratic leaders to experiment with new ways of appealing to Republicans, especially those who changed their allegiance from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/on-the-money&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; comes from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, a collection of public opinion researchers. Lee Drutman, Vanessa Williamson and Felicia Wong, political scientists, found that economic attitudes among Americans affiliated with the Republican Party are deeply divided by income level, with lower-income Republicans holding more progressive economic views. Factoring in only economic preferences—for raising the minimum wage, allowing workers to unionise and enacting government policies that decrease economic inequality—a significant share of Republicans would look like Democrats. “About 19% of Republicans held economic policy positions closer to the average Democrat than the average Republican”, say the authors, while “just 9% of Democrats held economic positions closer to the average Republican”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many Republicans an astute Democrat could target, they reckon. Only 71% of “economically left Republicans”—who make up about 7% of the electorate overall—have pledged their support for Mr Trump in 2020, compared to 90% of economically right-leaning Republicans. Furthermore, according to the report, Democrats made gains among left-leaning independents in the 2018 mid-terms which could amount to a one percentage point increase in vote share next year. Though small, this increase would have been more than enough to tip the scales against Mr Trump in Midwestern states in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates including Elizabeth Warren (pictured), a senator from Massachusetts, are betting that they can win these voters by putting class struggle rather than identity at the forefront of their campaigns. Ms Warren has focused her campaign on a tax on the super-wealthy, reforming the campaign finance system and corporate tax-dodging, for example. Last week, she unveiled a plan specifically designed to appeal to disaffected voters in the heartland. Her “Plan for Economic Patriotism” promises to deliver “faster growth, stronger American industry, and more good American jobs” instead of catering to companies that have “no particular allegiance to America”. Her patriotic messaging could tug at the nationalistic heartstrings Mr Trump strummed in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To succeed, Ms Warren’s approach relies on the de-emphasis of the politics of race. Anti-immigrant attitudes had a much bigger influence on Americans’ vote choice in 2016 than economic attitudes did. The odds that Mr Trump—who began his last campaign with a rhetorical assault on Mexican immigrants—will continue to rely on dog-whistle politics is high. On June 17th, he tweeted a proposal to expel millions of immigrants without documentation. The following day, when he launched his re-election campaign he mentioned immigrants, his border wall or immigration reform at least 20 times. By keeping issues of race and immigration on voters’ minds, Mr Trump would decrease the chance of a class-based message breaking through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if 2016 was about how Republicans exploited social polarisation and last year’s mid-terms were about how Democrats exploited attitudes toward health care, the 2020 election could be decided at least in part by Republicans’ divide on economic attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Elizabeth Warren get the opportunity to try? This week, a survey of 1,500 Americans conducted on behalf of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; by YouGov, a polling firm, found that 26% of the party’s primary voters prefer Joe Biden, the former vice-president, over any other candidate. But Ms Warren is on an upward swing. YouGov&amp;#x27;s poll was the second one in which Ms Warren polled even or higher than Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And her position may improve again after she appears in the first Democratic primary debate on June 26th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 02:39:55 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The race to become Britain’s next PM]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/21/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm]]></link><description>&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-17T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HERESA MAY&lt;/small&gt; stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7th, but she will remain as prime minister until her successor is chosen.
