These stickers have appeared as the result of a public outcry in recent months over the unpublicised installation of video cameras on these screens on at least four airlines. The fuss began in February on a Singapore Airlines flight, when a passenger noticed what appeared to be a camera lens by her video screen. Her husband, a cybersecurity expert, tweeted a photo of it. The airline confirmed that it was a camera. On some of their planes with newer entertainment systems, the fitters of the interiors had installed devices with an embedded camera. But Singapore Airlines said that the cameras had been “disabled” and they had no plans to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;That did nothing to quell public anxiety, which only grew with news reports later the same month that some screens on the big three American carriers, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, also had cameras on-board. In March two American senators demanded that eight American carriers disclose whether they were using cameras to monitor passengers and whether passengers were being informed. The airlines insisted that the cameras were not operational, but they scrambled to cover them up anyway. United and Delta recently began covering all the cameras on their entertainment systems. American has also announced plans to do the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ought to end the panic. But it also raises the question of why people were worried about these cameras in the first place. Of course it would be wrong for airlines to spy on their customers. But the threat to privacy from this is nothing compared to the greater threat of hackers gaining access to the webcams on laptops in people’s homes, or to virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa. Aircraft, particularly in economy class, are not private places. Anything a passenger says or does can be witnessed by dozens of people. It is undeniably important for airlines to protect passengers’ privacy when it comes to their personal data—and a strict legal requirement in Europe with so-called GDPR rules. But a passenger’s behaviour while sitting in an aircraft seat—snoring, or watching a low-brow movie, or maybe picking one’s nose—is just not all that private to begin with, nor is it of much interest to companies or hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger concern is what flyers would actually do with these cameras, if they became operational. The chief technology officer of Panasonic, one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of airline-entertainment systems, which recently rolled out a new generation of their devices containing cameras and microphones, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;that these devices were intended to eventually allow airlines to offer seat-to-seat or plane-to-ground video calls. Imagine a plane on which half the passengers are video-chatting to friends a few rows away or relatives back home, if you want to read a book or do some work quietly. That sounds far more disturbing than any hypothetical spying. So, on second thought, it might be a good idea to keep those cameras covered up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 03:12:12 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why the public prefers eccentric Christians to archbishops]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/05/10/why-the-public-prefers-eccentric-christians-to-archbishops]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190511_BLP513.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-10T11:31:12Z&quot;&gt;May 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANITY IS the world’s most popular religion, with over 2bn followers, according to the Pew Research Centre, an American think-tank. It is the historically predominant faith in most prosperous democracies. Yet over the past century, only a limited number of Christians have gained commanding respect and influence for the way they lived out their faith, in their own countries and beyond. And many—most, even—have been idiosyncratic characters who have chosen to live outside most formal structures, or at the very edge of those structures, rather than mighty hierarchs of the church. Often they were people who had the option of living conventional, secure lives but at a certain point made radically different choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such person was Jean Vanier, who died this week. He was a Canadian diplomat’s son who served as a naval officer, then as a professor of theology and philosophy, but was inspired to change course after seeing the dreary conditions inside an institution for men with learning difficulties near Paris. That inspired him to open a home where people with mental-health or cognitive problems would be valued and invited to contribute to the community. He promoted an ethos than turned on its head the conventional notion of what it means to be normal and successful, and the result was a movement that eventually spread to 35 countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strange and charismatic (in several senses) character was Brother Roger (pictured with Mother Teresa), who became a kind of monk despite being born into a French-Swiss Protestant tradition in which monasticism hardly exists. As the founder of the Taizé community in eastern France, he was somehow able to communicate with a younger generation that was abandoning formal religion in droves, but still felt a kind of spiritual thirst. Like Vanier, he died in France at the age of 90, but the end of Roger’s life, after he was stabbed by a mentally disturbed Romanian woman, was far uglier. By the time of his passing in 2005, prayer groups modelled on his community had formed across North America. If his style of spiritual guidance had a hallmark, it was a willingness to listen as well as preach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even harder to place in any box, perhaps, was Dorothy Day, a social and political activist who lived much of her life in rough areas of New York, where she rubbed shoulders with socialists, communists and hippies, while finding commonalities and differences with them all. As a founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, she declared herself a “pacifist even in the class struggle” although she professed to understand perfectly well why the poor wanted to rise up against their oppressors. It was a stance that exasperated both secular lefists and Christian conservatives, but her integrity compelled a grudging respect. For all her radicalism on economics, she adhered to Catholic teaching on sexual and reproductive issues, saying she regretted having an abortion. Utterly different as she was from the Catholic bishops of her day, she may eventually be proclaimed a saint. A process that could lead to canonising her began under Pope John Paul II in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another place on the spectrum of idiosyncratic sanctity was occupied by Mother Teresa, the ethnic Albanian nun who worked among the destitute in Kolkata and founded a missionary order that eventually spread to more than 130 countries. When she died in 1997, her labour among the “poorest of the poor” was saluted by the leaders of India and Pakistan, who were neither Christian nor in agreement about much else. She had her critics, some of whom branded her indifferent to the root causes of poverty, and opposed to the female empowerment which might have improved living standards. Some felt that she was too quick to seek the approval of the rich and powerful. But people respected her manifest indifference to her own material comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one more example of holy, disinterested eccentricity, take the figure of Maria Skobtsova, the cigarette-smoking Russian nun who lived among the down-and-out in Paris in the 1930s and was eventually executed in a Nazi gas chamber in 1945. Practising the ideal of unconditional hospitality, she was critical of the ritualistic piety of some fellow members of the Russian diaspora in France, and she doubtless infuriated some of them. But she was the one who was eventually recognised as a martyr, not her pious compatriots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What all these people have in common is the fact that they embraced uncomfortable lives, even though they had experienced a relatively comfortable existence and might have held onto it. Dorothy Day was the daughter of secular middle-class Americans, her father a sports writer. Mother Teresa could have practised her monastic vocation in Ireland, a land where she lived as a young woman. Skobstova was a talented poet and well-trained intellectual who could certainly have enjoyed the secular side of life as a Russian émigré.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reputation of a “saint”, whether in the strict sense or a somewhat broader one, is a fickle thing. The spectacle of self-abnegation in a higher cause is both fascinating and to some observers, a bit suspicious. Presented with any paragon of virtue, people immediately start asking themselves what flaws this altruistic individual had, and if the flaws turn out to be rather glaring, that can come as a kind of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when facing public scrutiny, mitred princes of the church are at a particular disadvantage. They must convince sceptical onlookers that the trappings of power and prestige which they  enjoy by virtue of their office are being worn with humility, and in a spirit of concern for others. (If they have personal experience of persecution, as John Paul II did under Nazism and communism, that certainly adds credibility.) But in general, today’s world, both religious and otherwise, prefers a mud-caked eccentric to a gorgeous episcopal robe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 01:07:38 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The refugee train from Sarajevo]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/news/2019/05/11/the-refugee-train-from-sarajevo]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/bihac_train.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-11T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE flyblown plaza in front of Sarajevo’s railway station is called “Srebrenica Genocide Victims Square”. The echoey, empty station is like a cathedral. When Sarajevo, Bosnia’s capital, was at the heart of the former Yugoslavia it bustled. Now only 11 trains a day depart, and 11 arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand quite how sad a state of affairs this is, compare it to the central station in Zagreb, the capital of neighbouring Croatia. Its population is, admittedly, 40% larger than Bosnia’s. Yet Zagreb’s station has more than 16 times as much rail traffic, not counting trains serving the city’s suburban stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a time when you could get from Sarajevo by train to most of Europe. But in the last few years financial disputes have cut Bosnian railways off from the rest of the world. Now you can’t even take a train from here to Croatia, let alone farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have come to Sarajevo station to catch the train to Banja Luka, now the capital of the Serb part of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Its government denies that a genocide took place in Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serb soldiers killed some 8,000 Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) men and boys in 1995, towards the end of the Bosnian war.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Most Bosnians have lost the habit of train travel. “You are mad” said friends when I said I was taking the train: it will be disgusting and the toilets will be clogged. They don’t know that it is as modern a train as you will find anywhere in Europe. The rolling stock was delivered from Spain in 2010 and then parked in a siding until 2016, when tracks and infrastructure was finally upgraded to take them.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The first railway to Banja Luka, which connected it to Croatia, was laid by the Ottomans in 1872. Then came the Austro-Hungarians and finally the Yugoslavs. The link to Sarajevo—built by prisoners of war and communist youth brigades, including thousands of foreigners—was completed only in the early 1950s. During the Bosnian war the railways stopped running, except for small sections.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;When the train pulls in to Sarajevo, only one door is unlocked for passengers to get on. “That way” says the conductor pointing right. “What about that way?” I ask. “Migrants” he says brusquely, but if I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to sit with them that would be my choice. The migrants take the train on to Bihac, from where they try to sneak past border guards get to Croatia and then deeper into the EU. I am not here to write about them, but I join them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposite me is Morsal, 26 years old. She is travelling with her two-year-old daughter, who was born in a refugee camp in Serbia. Morsal explains that she used to be a policewoman in Afghanistan. She shows me a picture of a woman surrounded by white cloth and has something white on her mouth. It takes me a few seconds to realise that the subject is lying in a coffin. Morsal had received a call from a man who warned her to quit the police; a week later four men burst into her home and shot her 16-year-old sister dead, thinking it was Morsal. Within hours Morsal began her flight via Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia and now Bosnia.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Next to me is Asal, her parents and little brother. They are Iranian Kurds and for 15 years Asal’s father had been a member of an underground Kurdish political group. The Iranian security services discovered it, two members were executed and the family fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October Serbia ended a brief period of no-visa requirements for Iranians, but not before there had been an influx of asylum-seekers. “Did you fly to Serbia?” I ask. “No, we came with the mafia,” says a deadpan Asal. She is only 11-years old and speaks fantastic English.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;I have little doubt that Asal and Morsal will flourish in, and contribute to, any country that takes them in. I cannot say the same about a group of Algerian men in our carriage. One, who sports a top-knot, says his father is in France but he cannot get a visa to go there because, he chortles, he has been in jail four times “for fighting and that sort of thing”.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;At Banja Luka only one door opens, again. For some reason three of the migrants try to get off here. They are greeted by Bosnian Serb policemen who bark the equivalent of “Oi! Where do you think you are going?” No Muslim refugees are allowed off here.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;I ask the train crew why they separated the migrants from the other passengers, who are a mix of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats. Answer: “Because they complain that the migrants smell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately remembered the many refugees of the Yugoslav wars: Bosniaks who flopped exhausted into Croatia, one night in 1992, having been driven out by Bosnian Serbs; Serbs who had fled Croatia to Banja Luka on their tractors; and Croats going the other way on theirs to get away from Serbs. “Have all of you actually &lt;em&gt;forgotten&lt;/em&gt; that this was you not so long ago?” I want to ask them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosnian activists have helped the refugees. But for many Bosnians, regardless of ethnicity, the bitterness that lingers, almost a quarter of a century after the end of the war, seems to have squeezed out any sense of sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 00:31:50 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Success in academia is as much about grit as talent]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/10/success-in-academia-is-as-much-about-grit-as-talent]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190518_woc857.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-10T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN 1968 ROBERT MERTON, a sociologist at Columbia University, identified a feature of academic life that he called the Matthew effect. The most talented scientists, he observed, tend to have access to the most resources and the best opportunities, and receive a disproportionate amount of credit for their work, thus amplifying their already enhanced reputations and careers. Less brilliant ones, meanwhile, are often left scrambling for money and recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests this may not tell the whole story. A working paper by Yang Wang, Benjamin Jones and Dashun Wang of Northwestern University finds that success in the sciences does not always breed more success, and that scientists who fail early in their careers may benefit from the experience. The authors discovered this by collecting data on grant applications submitted between 1990 and 2005 to America’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) by junior-level scientists. In particular, they focused on two groups of applicants: those who received relatively high scores on their submissions but just missed getting a grant, and those who scored similarly well but just succeeded in being awarded one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three researchers found that, rather than automatically holding the failures back, as the Matthew effect might be thought to predict, an early-career setback of this sort was sometimes associated with greater academic success in the long run. While those who missed out on funding were more likely to drop out from the NIH system, the scientists who persevered and continued to apply for grants after their initial failure outperformed their counterparts who had succeeded first time, as measured by the number of citations of their research that they received over the subsequent ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of this can be explained by the weakest scientists in the no-grant group giving up, the three researchers showed that other, unobservable, characteristics such as “effort” or “grit” are also at work. Overall, the authors conclude, the findings are consistent with the concept that “what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 07:05:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Does gender equality start in the home?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/10/does-gender-equality-start-in-the-home]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190511_blp512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-10T14:20:02Z&quot;&gt;May 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne McElvoy asks Melinda Gates whether gender equality starts in the kitchen.

While politicians around the world have failed to pass much meaningful legislation on climate change, film-makers have captured melting ice caps, coral bleaching and devastating floods. On May 9th Netflix announced that “Our Planet”, a mini-series examining humanity’s impact on different species and habitats, was the most-watched title on the streaming site in Britain in April. These productions combine sumptuous cinematography, engaging animal narratives and policy recommendations, demonstrating how an individual’s behaviour can have wide-ranging repercussions. After “Blue Planet II” showed birds feeding their chicks debris from the ocean, an estimated 88% of viewers changed their consumption of single-use plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Biggest Little Farm”, a new documentary, looks at the challenge of sustainability from a much more intimate perspective. There are no playful orangutans or majestic sea turtles; instead it chronicles the journey of two urban-dwellers as they try to reintroduce biodiversity to an abandoned farm. By keeping its focus on practical issues and the realities of running a smallholding, the film offers a feel-good story of environmental recovery that, while sometimes overly simplistic, encourages viewers to reflect on the small changes they might make in their own lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John and Molly Chester start out as an average pair of health-conscious Angelenos. John is a wildlife cinematographer, while Molly is a chef with grand ideas about proper farming techniques but little experience of agricultural work. After being evicted from their home on short notice, they decide to put their passions to work and buy a farm. There they encounter soil that has been ruined by years of monoculture, so they hire a guide—Alan York, a “renowned expert in traditional farming practices”—to teach them how to cultivate more than 200 crops and feed a range of animals that will “self-regulate”. The idea is to create a system that will feed the soil and the people equally, and the Chesters approach this challenge with idealism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they soon encounter problems, and persistent ones. Pests, ranging from snails to coyotes, move in immediately; natural forces such as droughts, floods and wildfires—all of which have been exacerbated by climate change—mount a considerable threat to their project. “The Biggest Little Farm” depicts a relationship with the natural world that is by turns both life-affirming and horribly grim. The coyotes prove a constant menace, and John’s efforts to stymie them become the central narrative of the film. Images of ravaged chickens recur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/prospero/20190511_bkp510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/prospero/20190511_bkp510.jpg 200w,

He focuses his lens on the most miniscule of creatures, from ladybugs to dung beetles. When an animal that lives in manure gets a moment in the spotlight, it reflects the idea that, on a truly biodiverse farm, every player matters. Mr Chester resists the temptation to anthropomorphise these creatures, instead demonstrating the key role each plays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts in tone represent the endless cycles of life and death, of frustration and success, that come with a working farm. It is not the most dramatic narrative: at points the cycles become predictable, even while the film heads towards its happy ending. And though “The Biggest Little Farm” pointedly leaves out some of the most brutal elements of farming—the film asks the viewer to mourn for those animals killed by predators, but make little reference to what awaits the animals raised for meat—it is likely to succeed in encouraging its audience to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few will be able to copy the Chesters’ actions directly, but watching two ordinary people take initiative, face setbacks and overcome challenges in the name of a better world is inspiring enough. After witnessing the couple radically re-organise their priorities and risk their own livelihood, small sacrifices such as growing vegetables, eating less meat, avoiding plastic or taking public transportation more often may seem less daunting. It is a thoughtfully narrow approach, and a valuable addition to a thriving genre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Biggest Little Farm” is released in America on May 10th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 20:06:24 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Patrick Shanahan is likely to be America’s next defence secretary]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/05/09/patrick-shanahan-is-likely-to-be-americas-next-defence-secretary]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190511_blp904.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-09T23:48:37Z&quot;&gt;May 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PATRICK SHANAHAN has made little on mark on the Pentagon during his two years as deputy defence secretary and then acting secretary following James Mattis’s resignation in December. He has instituted no major reform. He has made no memorable statement on global affairs. People who have worked alongside the former Boeing executive sound ambivalent about him. A newcomer to foreign affairs and security policy, he is not known to have strong views, ideological or otherwise. He is said to be a competent manager, which might be considered a minimal requirement for leading America’s armed forces and the vast Pentagon bureaucracy. On May 9th the White House announced that Donald Trump intended to nominate Mr Shanahan to his job on a permanent basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a big change in what Mr Trump requires from his defence secretary. He picked Mr Mattis, a highly-respected former marine general, at a time when he was new to foreign affairs, unsure of the demands of the presidency and bedazzled by a man in uniform. He referred approvingly to him by his service nickname, “Mad Dog Mattis,” though the moniker was rarely used and Mr Mattis hated it. Mr Trump’s enthusiasm for Mr Mattis dwindled once it became clear that he was neither the bull-headed killer Mr Trump had taken him for, nor prepared to be the president’s own loyal general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on board with some of Mr Trump’s instincts—for example, in his stepped-up bombing campaigns against the Taliban and Islamic State—Mr Mattis quietly repudiated the president’s values. He spent much of his time flying around the world trying to reassure the traditional allies Mr Trump lambasted. He stymied Mr Trump’s efforts to ban transsexuals from the armed forces. He survived in the administration for as long as he did through a combination of discretion, chaos elsewhere in the cabinet, and the defence department’s enormous heft. By replacing Mr Mattis with a much less commanding figure, Mr Trump has signalled his preference for loyalty over stature in the most independent power-base within the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Shanahan showed his loyalty earlier this year by endorsing Mr Trump’s scheme to siphon billions of dollars from the defence budget to put towards a border-wall. He has also argued for the proposed new Space Force—in effect a sixth service branch—that Mr Trump has demanded. This is said to have won him over to Mr Trump, who had previously resisted pressure to make Mr Shanahan’s acting tenure permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of Mr Shanahan’s impending nomination follows the conclusion of a month-long Pentagon investigation into whether he improperly promoted Boeing and disparaged its competitors within the department. Though exonerated by the Pentagon’s acting inspector general, Mr Shanahan was described in his report as speaking peculiarly often—in almost every meeting—about his experience overseeing Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner programme. That points, if not to corruption, to his unusual callowness in government, which Republican national-security hawks such as Lindsey Graham are said to be troubled by. It will also make him a target for Democratic senators in his confirmation hearings. An investigation by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; found that the production facility in North Carolina that makes the Dreamliner has been subject to many allegations of poor safety standards, as managers rushed to meet production targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming Mr Shanahan is confirmed, his low profile and business background could both turn out to be beneficial for the defence department. It is locked in a perpetual struggle with the sorts of glitches, including inefficient basing, overstaffing and costly acquisitions programmes, he prides himself on solving at Boeing. More traditional defence secretaries—including Mr Mattis—routinely vow to get grips with such problems, before getting distracted by global security. That is less likely to happen to Mr Shanahan, who announced when taking over from Mr Mattis that he intended to travel much less than his predecessor had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flip-side of his leadership would probably be a diminution of the Pentagon’s role in shaping foreign and security policy. This is good news for Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, the belligerent secretary of state and national secretary adviser. They are already profiting from Mr Mattis’s absence. Having the ear of Mr Trump, who likes their style if not necessarily their bellicosity, they have taken the lead on security issues such as Iran—to which Mr Pompeo promised on May 9th a “swift and decisive” US response to any provocation. As well as being far better versed in foreign affairs, both are more adept inter-departmental players than Mr Shanahan, who has the least government experience of almost any defence secretary of recent times. While presiding over by far the biggest government department, he might struggle to check his cabinet colleagues. He will not check Mr Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 20:06:23 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“The glue between these two countries has really come unstuck”—on America and China]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/10/the-glue-between-these-two-countries-has-really-come-unstuck-on-america-and-china]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/intell.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-10T11:30:24Z&quot;&gt;May 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUST AS negotiations to end the trade war between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/05/11/the-us-china-trading-relationship-will-be-fraught-for-years-to-come&quot;&gt;America and China&lt;/a&gt; seemed imminent, the Trump administration increased tariffs on Chinese goods.

But there was no truce on the menu. One minute after midnight in Washington on May 10th, America carried through on its threat to ratchet up tariffs on Chinese goods. Two minutes later, China vowed to hit back. And so the world’s two biggest economies staggered a couple of steps closer to all-out trade war. Such an outcome is still far from certain: talks are continuing and, until recently, had been making progress. But the risks are rising of economic damage in both countries, and of a rupture in their already strained relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased tariffs apply to a $200bn tranche of imports from China, including a wide range of industrial inputs such as car parts and circuit boards. Last September, in an early salvo, America hit this tranche with 10% tariffs (a further $50bn-worth had already been struck by tariffs of 25%). Now that 10% has been raised to 25% too, meaning the rate applies to almost half of Chinese exports of goods to America. China has yet to detail its retaliation plans, though it is likely to apply proportionate tariffs: aiming at fewer goods (since it imports less from America than America does from it) but also raising duties to 25%. Liquefied natural gas, meat and fruit are expected to be on its list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this escalation the cost from their trade brawl will soon become more visible. The new tariffs will shave as much as half a percentage point off China’s growth rate this year, according to most estimates. When tariffs were 10%, companies could generally digest the higher prices for Chinese imports, which were offset in part by a weaker yuan. At 25% they will struggle to do that, forcing them to pass more pain on to consumers. Inflation in America could increase by about half a percentage point as a result, according to economists at Société Générale, a French bank. And there could be worse to come. President Donald Trump said that America was starting the paperwork to impose 25% tariffs on the remaining $300bn or so of imports from China not yet affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a week ago the mood regarding the talks was upbeat. Chinese and American officials had met multiple times since the start of the year. The outlines of a deal were becoming visible China would go at least partway to addressing American demands that it enhance protection of intellectual property, stop coerced technology transfers and open its market more widely to foreign investors. It would also throw in pledges to buy large volumes of American goods, notably farm products, in order to narrow its bilateral trade surplus, a long-standing gripe of Mr Trump’s. America, in turn, would agree to remove at least some tariffs on Chinese products. On April 28th Steven Mnuchin, America’s treasury secretary, said talks were in their “final laps”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on May 5th, Mr Trump fired off a pair of tweets that shattered the optimism. China, he said, had been attempting to renegotiate the deal. The nature of the dispute is itself a matter of dispute. According to Reuters, citing American government sources, Chinese officials had asked for sweeping edits to a 150-page draft agreement. Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, wanted China’s commitments to be enshrined in legislation; Chinese negotiators countered that regulatory changes would be sufficient. But according to Chinese government advisers, the disagreements may run even deeper. They say that American negotiators have, in effect, asked China to undermine its own economic model in demanding that it eliminate subsidies to favoured industries and state-owned firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the prospect of a breakdown in negotiations, it was heartening that Liu He, China’s lead trade envoy, still went to Washington for talks that began on May 9th. Some had speculated that China might call off the meetings entirely. But the scope for progress seems limited for now. Chinese officials have long said that they will not make deals in the face of threats. Comments by Mr Liu on his arrival at the talks suggested that he was there more to reinforce that message than to make any big concessions. “I have come with sincerity,” he told Chinese state media, speaking in measured tones. The two delegations met and had dinner on May 9th and were due to resume their talks on May 10th, albeit with higher tariffs in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big worry is the potential political fallout from failed talks. Allegations that China reneged on its commitments are catnip for American critics of engagement with it. Trade is, after all, just one aspect of a spiralling mistrust that encompasses politics, technology and armed forces. In China, hawks have always suspected that America’s ultimate goal is to stop it from rising—a belief that has been reinforced by the trade dispute. Left-wing scholars argue that it would amount to treachery for China to give in to America’s demands. Their commercial relationship used to help bind China and America together; now it is driving a wedge between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most economists still think that the two countries will eventually reach a deal. As the downsides from tariffs become clearer, the reasons to strike an agreement, however tenuous, will prevail. But that is another way of saying that things may have to get worse before they get better. Exactly how much worse is the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 19:06:23 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
