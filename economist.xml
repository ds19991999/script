Since arriving in June 2017, he has done so with record-breaking frequency. On June 1st he scored his 71st goal in 104 appearances, to inspire the Reds to victory in the Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious competition. As usual, he celebrated by kneeling in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that Mr Salah—whom another chant describes as a “gift from Allah”—has converted many fans to Islam. But a working paper by political scientists at Stanford University has found signs that his popularity might have helped to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment on Merseyside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cleanest evidence came from a Facebook experiment on 8,000 British Liverpool fans. The academics gave each respondent a survey containing footballing facts and questions; a third of surveys also included a slide describing Mr Salah’s commitment to praying. Then all users were asked about their attitudes to Muslims. Of those who saw the slide about Mr Salah’s faith, 23% thought Islam was compatible with British values, compared with 18% of the other fans. Although most Liverpool supporters may know about Mr Salah’s faith anyway, the experiment showed that a reminder could alter their opinions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academics also hunted for signs of broader changes in Islamophobic sentiment in Liverpool since Mr Salah was signed. First they looked at hate crimes, in which the perpetrator is motivated by race, religion or another type of identity. Of 23 English regions analysed, almost all saw a rise in the number of such crimes in the ten months after Mr Salah’s arrival, part of a long-term trend that the Home Office puts down to better recording by the police. Merseyside, by contrast, reported a slight fall. The researchers built statistical models to predict monthly rates of various types of offences in Liverpool, and found that hate crimes had been 19% less common than expected, a gap that did not exist for any other illegal activity, suggesting that any “Salah effect” was limited to religious tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers turned to Twitter. They identified British followers of Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton (a Merseyside rival), and analysed 44,000 tweets that mentioned Muslims, Arabs or mosques. In the 14 months after Mr Salah’s transfer, 7.6% of Islam-related tweets by Liverpool fans had negative sentiments, about the same as the 7.3% during the previous three years. But the figure for Everton jumped from 18.6% to 21.3%; for the other teams it rose from 7.1% to 10.9%. Online Islamophobia in Liverpool seems to have been kept in check at a time when it was rising elsewhere. (The researchers found no sign that the broader increase was caused by jealous fans abusing Mr Salah.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most parts of the country, including Merseyside, saw a spike in anti-Muslim sentiment in the summer of 2017, after terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. If Mr Salah has played even a small part in reining in Liverpool fans’ prejudice since then, that is an achievement as remarkable as leading the club to European glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 05:40:17 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The race to become Britain’s next PM]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/05/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm]]></link><description>&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-05T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 5th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HERESA MAY&lt;/small&gt; has announced that she will step down as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7th.

Studying marine ecosystems is far harder. Even discovering which species are there, let alone in what quantities, can be tricky. But an insight by Stefano Mariani of the University of Salford, in Britain, may make things easier. As he describes in Current Biology, he thinks that sponges growing on the sea floor may offer a short cut to such information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way of sampling marine life is to sample the seawater itself, looking for DNA shed by creatures as they go about their lives. This is known to work in principal, but in practice it means running huge amounts of water through filters, to extract things like shed skin and blood cells for analysis. That is awkward, meaning sampling tends to be patchy. And attempts to automate the process using drones are proving pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponges, however, are natural filters. Indeed, they make their livings that way, sucking in thousands of litres of water a day and running it through intricate systems of channels that trap particles of organic matter, which they then digest. Taking samples from sponges, and checking the DNA therein, might thus, Dr Mariani reasoned, be an effective way to assess the diversity of species in the region surrounding a particular sponge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea in principle he and his colleagues removed some pieces from sponges collected originally for other research purposes. Five of these had come from Antarctica and four from the Mediterranean. Analysis revealed, in the Antarctic samples, the presence of animals including chinstrap penguins, Weddell seals and Perknaster aurantiacus, a type of starfish. In the Mediterranean samples there were rock gobies, horse mackerel and sardines. The quality of the DNA was not always sufficient to make a precise identification all the way down to the level of “species”, but, overall, the researchers recognised genetic material from at least 31 different groups of animal—meaning that was the minimum number of species represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is but a fraction of the total likely to have been present in the sponges home areas, and the data also give little idea of the size of those populations. To do all that would mean looking at a lot more sponges. Equally clearly though, Dr Mariani’s method does work in principle. Refining it and making it more sensitive is now a matter of detail. Since sponges cost nothing to manufacture, deploy or maintain, and also regenerate when they have pieces removed from them, they may thus turn out to be an ideal way of monitoring what is going on, unseen, in Davy Jones’s biological locker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 02:39:55 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fusing the future—a power struggle]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/05/fusing-the-future-a-power-struggle]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/babbage_gradient_map_80__1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-05T17:15:47Z&quot;&gt;Jun 5th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THIS week’s Babbage, Alok Jha, our science correspondent, investigates a &lt;strong&gt;technology that could solve all of the world’s energy problems in a stroke—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/05/04/fusion-power-is-attracting-private-sector-interest&quot;&gt;nuclear fusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

How about a “beautiful” photo-book of North Korean ships illegally transferring oil at sea? Patrick Shanahan, America’s acting defence secretary, presented the collection of grainy aerial shots to his Chinese counterpart, General Wei Fenghe, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual gathering of military bigwigs in Singapore from May 31st to June 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an emollient gesture in fractious times. When Banyan asked Mr Shanahan what he planned to say to General Wei in private, the answer was not a tirade about Huawei or the South China Sea. Instead Mr Shanahan said he was “excited” to explore areas of co-operation. North Korean sanctions-busting—which often occurs in Chinese waters—was top of the list. Such collaboration would show that America and China could “compete in a constructive way”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 1st the Pentagon published its plans for that competition in an Indo-Pacific strategy. At its heart was the idea of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” (FOIP), a nebulous concept conceived by Japan and enthusiastically taken up by the Trump administration. In essence, FOIP is a rules-based rejoinder to China’s vision of spheres of influence, gunboat diplomacy and murky loans. “No one nation can or should dominate the Indo-Pacific,” said the Pentagon in its report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Shanahan’s notion of responsible competition—in contrast to the no-holds-barred clash of civilisations favoured by some of his head-banging colleagues—is laudable. It is also savvy. Asian states are likelier to sign up to FOIP if they are persuaded that America is not spoiling for a fight. But on both counts—stabilising the relationship with China, while rallying partners to push back against it—America has an uphill task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the olive branches. General Wei did not so much ignore them as snap them into pieces. “Arise, all those who do not want be enslaved,” he thundered in his speech on June 2nd, quoting China’s national anthem. “Let us build the new Great Wall with our flesh and blood.” He warned that China’s army was “not afraid of sacrifice” and that “we make no promise to renounce the use of force” against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think that such bluster would send Asians rushing to sign up to FOIP and into America’s arms. In some cases, it has. Narendra Modi will deepen defence ties with America in his second term. Japan is beefing up its armed forces and sending its navy into the South China Sea. Officials from America, Australia, India and Japan—the “Quad”—now confer routinely, most recently on May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All pay lip service to the idea that the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), a club of ten mostly smaller powers, should be at the core of FOIP. The problem is that not all in ASEAN are sold on the idea. For one thing, many are unconvinced that America will truly stick around, as the costs of any war with China grow over time. So why risk China’s ire? “The Chinese coast guard is bigger than Malaysia’s warships,” lamented Malaysia’s defence minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Shanahan did his best to assuage these concerns. He pointed out that the Indo-Pacific was America’s “priority theatre”, with four times as many American forces as any other American military command. America’s freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea were also growing more routine: unusually, there were two in May alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But muscle is only half of it. The larger issue is that Donald Trump’s unpredictably incendiary foreign policy sits uneasily with the principles of FOIP. Tensions with Iran are pulling America’s attention back to the Middle East. The compulsive resort to tariffs undercuts a rules-based trading order. Mr Trump’s lack of interest in human rights hardly furthers freedom. And to many in Asia, America’s war on Huawei or its sanctions against buyers of Russian arms or Iranian oil look an awful lot like China’s “toolkit of coercion”, as Mr Shanahan put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is unfair. An Asian order sculpted by China would be more capricious and suffocating than anything Mr Trump could devise. General Wei’s brazen defence of the Tiananmen Square massacre—he called it a “correct policy” that gave China the stability to grow richer—was a reminder of the ideological stakes. Australia, India and Japan are on board. Singapore and Vietnam’s sympathies are clear. But most ASEAN countries hate the idea of taking sides, despite widespread misgivings about China’s intentions. Mr Shanahan reckons they will eventually come round. “I think they’re building up their confidence,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 01:39:55 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fusing the future]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/05/fusing-the-future]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/babbage_gradient_map_80__1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-05T17:15:47Z&quot;&gt;Jun 5th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THIS week’s Babbage, Alok Jha, our science correspondent, investigates a &lt;strong&gt;technology that could solve all of the world’s energy problems in a stroke—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/05/04/fusion-power-is-attracting-private-sector-interest&quot;&gt;nuclear fusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

The American president spends his “executive time” posting memes on Twitter. Video-streaming platforms are valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars. TikTok, an utterly baffling but hugely enjoyable app of very short, very weird videos, is taking the world by storm. Contemporary culture is dominated by the visual and the mass produced, and has been for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, prompted by a new exhibition of Japanese manga, newspapers are still asking whether modern visual culture has any place in museums. “I’m not knocking manga or its fans, but what has it got to do with the British Museum?” Jonathan Jones wrote in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “What’s next—Rembrandt meets Dennis the Menace?” the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; asked: “Is manga really as significant as Rodin and the Ancient Greeks?” The answers to these questions are, in order, everything, why not, and quite possibly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That designated tastemakers pooh-pooh any sign of an old institution dabbling in something new is perhaps predictable. But it is precisely for that reason that the British Museum ought to be lauded for putting on this dynamic, exuberant and ambitious celebration of Japan’s comic-art narrative form. It somehow manages to strike the right balance for every type of visitor, from the utter novice to the knowledgeable fan. For the newbie there are instructions on how to read from right to left, how to decipher the codes embedded in the speech bubbles, and introductions to famous artists and important texts. For the long-time fan, original prints of canonical works will prove a big draw (pardon the pun), as will displays of the historical prints and fabrics that have influenced the modern form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those, such as this reviewer, who fall somewhere in between—that is, with a passing acquaintance but nothing resembling expertise—it is an utter delight. The exhibition probes the historical roots of manga, with nods to Katsushika Hokusai, a famous artist and printmaker. It lays out the many genres and subgenres within the sprawling world of manga, and goes into satisfying detail on the cultural cross-pollination of American and Japanese comics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were it all prints and information cards, the exhibition could still have been a sweet if underwhelming attempt at bringing mass culture into the museum. But it is in expanding beyond the art itself, into the experience, that it truly highlights the significance that some critics fail to see. Just as the Greeks created plays and texts and ways of thinking and seeing the world that continue to touch the lives of millions, so too has manga created a global culture that millions participate in. Some dress up as their favourite characters, buy merchandise, read fan comics and blogs (or indeed make fan-art). Others read or are touched by other things that have been influenced by manga, such as Pokémon, which started life as a video game, was adapted into manga, and later morphed into a global phenomenon that layered a virtual world over the real one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing about the exhibition, however, is all the stuff that isn’t in it. Unlike an exhibition of Rembrandt, to take Mr Jones’s example, this show is an introduction, an enticement to fall down the deep rabbit hole of a different world of art and narrative and culture. That manga itself is mass-produced, inexpensive and easy to acquire on Amazon is an added bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Manga” continues at the British Museum until August 26th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 23:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Donald Trump’s visit to Britain goes well—at least for him]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/06/05/donald-trumps-visit-to-britain-goes-well-at-least-for-him]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_brp503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-05T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 5th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONALD TRUMP saw only people cheering, not protests, reports of which the president branded “fake news”. They did not seem so fake on Whitehall. Placards said “Dump Trump”, “Trump: Climate Disaster” and “Keep Trump away from our NHS”. One optimistic poster proposed “Stop Brexit, stop Trump”. Most bizarre was a banner saying “Man Utd fans against apartheid”. The mood was cheerful, even carnival-like—at least until it rained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ever, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn came out to back the protests. But his disdain was diluted after Mr Trump revealed that he had rejected a meeting request from Mr Corbyn, whom he dubbed a “negative force”. He said the same of Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, calling him a “stone-cold loser”. This contrasted with his enthusiasm for Brexiteers, singling out Boris Johnson as a great potential successor to Theresa May as prime minister. He also met Nigel Farage, whose new Brexit Party is eating into Tory support, suggesting he should be one of the Brexit negotiators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president clearly valued hobnobbing with royalty and feasting in Buckingham Palace with the queen (whom he called a “fantastic woman”) more than bilateral discussions with Mrs May. But although he said he would have negotiated Brexit differently, by suing the European Union, he also praised Mrs May’s deal. And he glossed over differences on Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant mistrusted by America but cautiously accepted in Britain, by saying that the two countries would soon reach an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade was trickier. Mr Trump promised a “phenomenal” post-Brexit deal that would double or even triple bilateral trade. But he also echoed his ambassador by saying that everything should be on the table. That includes not just farm products but access to the NHS. When most Tory leadership candidates instantly said the NHS was not up for sale, Mr Trump backtracked. But his own trade negotiating documents make clear that the Americans will look for more NHS contracts and fairer access for drugs. What’s more, Congress has said it will not ratify any trade deal if Brexit is seen to threaten peace in Northern Ireland. A bilateral deal looks both hard and far off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British managed to get in a few subtler digs of their own, with the queen and Mrs May going out of their way to praise the role of international institutions, which Mr Trump has criticised or in some cases abandoned. The prime minister openly admitted to differences on climate change and Iran, and she used this week’s D-day commemoration to remind the president of the value of NATO in upholding the global order. Mr Trump’s response was to repeat his demand that NATO allies spend more on defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides praising Mr Johnson, with whom he spoke by phone, Mr Trump sought meetings with Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, whom he said would make a good prime minister, and with Michael Gove, the environment secretary, whom he claimed not to know. The White House has clearly decided these are the three strongest candidates to succeed Mrs May. It is not obvious that Mr Trump’s support will prove helpful, any more than was Barack Obama’s backing for the Remain campaign in 2016. Yet it could weigh with some Tory party members. Certainly Mr Hunt and Mr Gove seemed pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 23:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
