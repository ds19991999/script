Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic have seen record-breaking temperatures for June. France has recorded its highest temperature—45.1C (113.2F)—of all time. Heatwave, scream myriad headlines. But what exactly is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha and the Vandellas had a definition. According to their hit of the same name, released in 1963, a heatwave involved an inability to stop crying, the feeling of being possessed by the devil, high blood pressure, and a “burning in my heart”. Their wording is a model of precision compared with that provided by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the UN agency that calls itself “the authoritative voice on the state and behaviour of the world’s atmosphere”. A heatwave, it says, is a “marked warming of the air, or the invasion of very warm air, over a large area; it usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks”. That sounds downright pleasant to residents of cooler climes and does not capture the lethal menace of the weather phenomenon. Is there not something more precise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments have been late to the game when it comes to establishing exact criteria for heatwaves and public heat-warning systems. They have been more active since 2003, when stories about elderly people in France dying alone while their families were on holiday fed public outrage. And they have also responded to the increased frequency of periods of extreme heat in recent years. Yet a survey by the WMO in 2015 found that around one-third of countries still lacked criteria for defining and reacting to heatwaves. Worryingly there is no commonly accepted definition for the point at which the public should be alerted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some differences are logical because heatwave warnings depend in part on what residents are used to. The temperatures currently keeping Parisians sweating on the Metro would barely warrant a mention in Furnace Creek, California, which has recorded the world’s highest temperature (56.7°C, or 134°F, in 1913). It makes sense to tailor warnings to local conditions. For example, Environment Canada, a government department, warns residents of Prince Edward Island when the temperature will reach 27°C, but sets a threshold of 35°C for the arid interior of south-eastern British Columbia. But maximum temperature is only one of a number of variables that can add up to a killer heatwave. Others include humidity, air pollution, wind conditions, the minimum night-time temperature and how long the hot spell lasts. National definitions vary widely, depending on which of these variables are included, how they are measured, and even on the timing of warnings. An alert in England means the heatwave is expected within three days. In Belgium, it means the hot weather has already arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WMO is encouraging climate and health scientists to develop a measure that could be used more widely in forecasts and warnings. Many are in development, including a universal thermal climate index, which combines air temperature with measures of its effect on the human body. But for now, the answer to what is a heatwave is that it depends on where you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 23:40:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“Yesterday” is more a love letter to the Beatles than a rom-com]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/06/28/yesterday-is-more-a-love-letter-to-the-beatles-than-a-rom-com]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190629_BKP511.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-28T11:20:54Z&quot;&gt;Jun 28th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE IS a particular genre of comedy in which an unremarkable man suddenly finds himself to be the only person in the world with some miraculous knowledge or power. He might have realised that he is stuck in a time loop (like Bill Murray in “Groundhog Day”), or gained the ability to fast-forward his life (like Adam Sandler in “Click”). Sometimes his gift is godly (such as Jim Carrey’s omnipotence in “Bruce Almighty”), and sometimes sinful (as for Ricky Gervais in “The Invention of Lying”). At first he marvels at his superpower. Then he abuses it. Eventually, he renounces it, having failed to woo a beautiful woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that genre belongs “Yesterday”, a new comedy written by Richard Curtis (of “Notting Hill” fame) and directed by Danny Boyle (an Oscar winner for “Slumdog Millionaire”). This hero’s gift is zany. Jack (Himesh Patel), a shelf-stacker and frustrated busker, wakes up after a traffic accident to find that nobody else has heard of the Beatles. He records every tune that he can remember, winning fans on local radio, then at concerts, and finally with a juicy recording deal in America. Lily James plays Ellie, his old friend and love interest, whom Jack alienates as he becomes (to borrow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_popular_than_Jesus&quot;&gt;John Lennon’s phrase&lt;/a&gt;) more popular than Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like “Groundhog Day” or “Bruce Almighty”, “Yesterday” gets most of its humour from the supernatural conceit, rather than its characters. The chemistry between ardent Jack and bashful Ellie is enough to keep the plot interesting, as the burgeoning superstar tries to win her over. But it would not carry a film without the Beatles premise. Nor does the patter among Jack’s friends and family produce much hilarity. There are few of the guffaw-inducing &lt;em&gt;faux pas&lt;/em&gt; or witty ripostes that made Mr Curtis’s early work, such as “Blackadder” and “Four Weddings and a Funeral”, so entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debra (Kate McKinnon), Jack’s mercenary American manager, yields a few chuckles: she describes Jack’s own, non-Beatles, compositions as “simple but not charming”. Yet her character does little else than tempt Jack with “the poisoned chalice of fame and money”. (“In the name of money, stop!” she yells when he is on the verge of giving it all away.) Ed Sheeran makes a lengthy cameo as an insufferable version of himself, insisting that Jack should call his masterpiece “Hey Dude”, among other unhelpful suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/prospero/20190629_bkp510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/prospero/20190629_bkp510.jpg 200w,

When Jack first plays “Yesterday” to his friends, one of them remarks that it is hardly as good as Coldplay. His parents refer to his new piano ballad as “Leave It Be”. Jack himself struggles to remember what exactly Eleanor Rigby was doing in the church—a challenge that even Beatles aficionados will find tricky without looking up the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film was made for that sort of fan. Mr Boyle has called it his “love letter to the Beatles and their music”. By coincidence, he and Mr Curtis—who had previously written “The Boat That Rocked”, a film about pirate radio stations in the 1960s—are standing next to each other on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9179906/Sgt-Pepper-revisited-for-2012.html&quot;&gt;a commemorative version of the famous “Sgt. Pepper” album cover&lt;/a&gt;, which Sir Peter Blake, the original artist, redesigned for his 80th birthday in 2012. They have woven countless references to the songs into the script. Jack’s traffic accident occurs to the sound of the crashing piano chords from “A Day in the Life”. While fixing Jack’s teeth, his local dentist explains that he gets by with a little help from his friends. Jack’s first concert as Mr Sheeran’s supporting act is in Russia, and he opens with “Back in the U.S.S.R.”. (Extra keen viewers will even notice mentions of lesser-known tracks, such as “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” and “Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite”.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any Beatles composition, there are a couple of profound moments among the fun. The most memorable is an unexpected appearance from a very important figure, who arrives to remind Jack that sometimes love is all you need. That poignant cameo alone is enough to make this essential viewing for any fan of the Fab Four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other spine-tingling scene comes when a jealous Mr Sheeran challenges Jack, in front of his entourage, to write the best song possible in ten minutes. After the pop star comes up with something vapid about penguins, Jack sits at the piano to play “The Long and Winding Road”. Everyone is spellbound. As Jack points out earlier in the film, when his audience hears one of the songs for the first time, it is “like watching Leonardo da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa right in front of your bloody eyes”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This film is very different to the recent biopics of Freddie Mercury (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/10/26/bohemian-rhapsody-is-more-fantasy-than-real-life&quot;&gt;Bohemian Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;”) and Elton John (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/05/20/rocketman-is-a-suitably-ostentatious-biopic-of-elton-john&quot;&gt;Rocketman&lt;/a&gt;”). But like those dramas, it is a paean to song-writing genius. The disbelief that Jack could compose so many brilliant tunes is a reminder of the improbability that four normal lads from Liverpool actually did produce them. At some point Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were all exasperated nobodies, who gradually astounded the world with their songs. Lucky for the world that they did—and that it will never wake up to find their records have disappeared from the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Yesterday” is released worldwide on June 28th &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 20:40:13 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Globalisation is dead and we need to invent a new world order]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/06/28/globalisation-is-dead-and-we-need-to-invent-a-new-world-order]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190629_OPP503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-28T09:51:59Z&quot;&gt;Jun 28th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAS THE world witnessed “peak democracy”? Is the future one in which open societies with free markets vie for influence in global affairs with authoritarian countries under state capitalism? The very questions evoke a nostalgia for a seemingly simpler past. For Michael O’Sullivan, formerly an investment banker and economist at Princeton University, it is more useful to consider the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr O’Sullivan’s book, “The Levelling: What&amp;#x27;s Next After Globalisation” offers a roadmap. He sees a multipolar world forming but international institutions unprepared for this. He voices worries about a world of low growth and high debt—and calls for a “world treaty on risk” so central banks only resort to measures like quantitative easing under agreed conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his most intriguing framing of the issues is his comparison of today’s world and 17th century England’s Putney Debates, when the practicalities of a rights-based democracy were first enunciated by a faction called “ The Levellers” (which inspired the book’s title). The world, he believes, will cleave into “Leveller” countries that hew to rights and freedoms, and “Leviathan” ones that are content with state-managed growth and fewer liberties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future initiative, we probed Mr O’Sullivan ideas in a short interview. Below that is an excerpt from his book, on the end of globalisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: Describe what comes after globalisation—what does the world you foresee look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp501.jpg 200w,

We should say goodbye to it and set our minds on the emerging multipolar world. This will be dominated by at least three large regions: America, the European Union and a China-centric Asia. They will increasingly take very different approaches to economic policy, liberty, warfare, technology and society. Mid-sized countries like Russia, Britain, Australia and Japan will struggle to find their place in the world, while new coalitions will emerge, such as a “Hanseatic League 2.0” of small, advanced states like those of Scandinavia and the Baltics. Institutions of the 20th century—the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation—will appear increasingly defunct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: What killed globalisation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael O&amp;#x27;Sullivan: At least two things have put paid to globalisation. First, global economic growth has slowed, and as a result, the growth has become more “financialised”: debt has increased and there has been more “monetary activism”—that is, central banks pumping money into the economy by buying assets, such as bonds and in some cases even equities—to sustain the international expansion. Second, the side effects, or rather the perceived side-effects, of globalisation are more apparent: wealth inequality, the dominance of multinationals and the dispersion of global supply chains, which have all become hot political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: Was the death of globalisation inevitable or could (and should) it have been prevented?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr O&amp;#x27;Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt;: One problematic factor here is that there is no central body or authority to shape globalisation, beyond perhaps the World Economic Forum or maybe the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In many ways, the end of globalisation is marked by the poor and inconclusive response to the global financial crisis. In general, the response has been to cut the cost of capital and not to tackle the root causes of the crisis. As such, the world economy will limp on, burdened by debt and in hock to easy money from central banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: The book&amp;#x27;s title comes from the &amp;quot;Levellers&amp;quot; during Britain&amp;#x27;s Putney Debates in the mid 1600s. Who were they and what can their story teach us today? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr O&amp;#x27;Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt;: The Levellers are a hidden gem from British history. They were a mid 17th century group in England, who participated in debates about democracy that took place in a part of London called Putney. Their achievement was crafting “An Agreement of the People,” which were a series of manifestos that marked the first popular conceptions of what a constitutional democracy might look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Levellers are interesting for two reasons. First, in the context of the time, their approach was constructive and practical. The “Agreement” spells out what people want from those who govern them in a clear and tangible way. For example, they proposed term limits on political office and that laws regarding indebtedness are applied equally to the rich and poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they are interesting for the way the movement was countermanded and then snuffed out by the military leader Oliver Cromwell and the Grandees (the elites of their day). Like so many idealistic political start-ups, the Levellers failed. This should encourage the growing number of new political parties, like Change UK and new candidates to be worldy-wise in how they approach the process of political reform and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: You foresee new international institutions to replace archaic 20th-century ones that are suited for a different time. How would they work? And can countries with such different values (ie, democratic, market-based &amp;quot;Levellers&amp;quot; and state-managed societies and economies, the &amp;quot;Leviathans&amp;quot;) really cooperate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr O&amp;#x27;Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot is made of the Cold War rivalry between communist Russia and America, and now some want to see a clash of civilizations between America and China. The “Levelling” characterises a future where there are at least two approaches to public life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most distinctive approach to nations doing things in their own way will be for what the Levellers might call the “rights of freeborn men,” or the idea of the open society. The code of the Levellers presents a very clear political formula that Europeans and Americans will recognise for its values, though decreasingly in its practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge to this code will come from the rising acceptance of less democratic ways of ordering society, in both developed and developing countries. A related clash will be the desire of a growing proportion of electorates to have a more open society as economies also open up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world evolves along the lines of Leveller-type and Leviathan-type societies, it is possible that in some countries, such as Russia, a Leviathan-like approach—that is, order in exchange for reduced democracy and rights—will be the accepted way of life. In other countries, most interestingly China, as its economy loses momentum and evolves, there may be a growing tension between groups holding the Leviathan view (supported inevitably by Grandees) and opposing Leveller-like groups (who favor equality of opportunity and a multiparty system). The role and views of women, especially in China, and of minority groups like the gay community will be pivotal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of a new world order, based on large regions and coloured by Leveller and Leviathan modes of governance, echoes several periods in history. The challenge in the next few years will be for Leviathan-oriented nations like China to maintain economic stability so that rising unemployment, for instance, does not break the “Leviathan contract”. Equally, the challenge in Leveller countries will be to maintain open, fraternal societies in the face of political and potentially economic volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good-bye to Globalisation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpted from “The Levelling: What&amp;#x27;s Next After Globalization” by Michael O&amp;#x27;Sullivan (PublicAffairs, 2019).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp502.jpg 200w,

Many will resist and, like the thirty-five foreign-policy experts who published an advertisement in the New York Times on July 26, 2018, under the banner “Why We Should Preserve International Institutions and Order,” will feel that the existing world order and its institutions should be maintained. I disagree. Globalization, at least in the form that people have come to enjoy it, is defunct. From here, the passage away from globalization can take two new forms. One dangerous scenario is that we witness the outright end of globalization in much the same manner as the first period of globalization collapsed in 1913. This scenario is a favorite of commentators because it allows them to write about bloody end-of-the-world calamities. This is, thankfully, a low-probability outcome, and with apologies to the many armchair admirals in the commentariat who, for instance, talk willfully of a conflict in the South China Sea, I suggest that a full-scale sea battle between China and the United States is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the evolution of a new world order—a fully multipolar world composed of three (perhaps four, depending on how India develops) large regions that are distinct in the workings of their economies, laws, cultures, and security networks—is manifestly underway. My sense is that until 2018, multipolarity was a more theoretical concept—more something to write about than to witness. This is changing quickly: trade tensions, advances in technologies (such as quantum computing), and the regulation of technology are just some of the fissures around which the world is splitting into distinct regions. Multipolarity is gaining traction and will have two broad axes. First, the poles in the multipolar world have to be large in terms of economic, financial, and geopolitical power. Second, the essence of multipolarity is not simply that the poles are large and powerful but also that they develop distinct, culturally consistent ways of doing things. Multipolarity, where regions do things distinctly and differently, is also very different from multilateralism, where they do them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, in particular, is interesting in the context of the switch from globalization to multipolarity, not least because at the 2017 World Economic Forum the Chinese president claimed the mantle of globalization for China. China benefited greatly from globalization and its accoutrements (e.g., WTO membership), and it played a vital role in the supply-chain dynamic that drove globalization. However, trade flows into China increasingly betray a move away from a globalized world and toward a more regionally focused one. For instance, IMF data show that in 2018, compared with 2011, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Malaysia traded more with China and relatively less with the United States. These countries, together with Bangladesh and Pakistan, have allowed themselves to be enticed by trade- and investment-based relationships with China and are now in its orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, China is itself not globalized: it is increasingly hard for Western companies to do business there on equal terms with Chinese companies, and the flow of both money and ideas—out of and into China, respectively—is heavily curtailed. Flow of people is another indicator. Flows within China are dynamic and are perhaps more managed than before, but flows of foreigners into China are miniscule by comparison to other countries, and China has only recently established an agency (the State Immigration Administration created at the 2018 Party Congress) to cultivate inward flows. So as China has become a major pole, it has become less globalized and arguably is contributing to the trend toward deglobalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a broader scale, without picking on individual countries, we can measure the extent to which the world is becoming multipolar by examining aggregate trends in trade, GDP, foreign direct investment, government budget size, and population. All of these are much less concentrated, or more dispersed, than they used to be, and increasingly they are collecting around several poles. For example, in the five years from 2012 to 2017, total foreign direct investment into Australia from China increased at a rate of 21 percent per annum, compared to 6 percent from the United States to Australia, suggesting that Asian investment in Australia is picking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if multipolarity is based on the growing dispersion and regionalization of economic power, it is also expressed in other ways, notably military power, political and cyberfreedoms, technological sophistication, financial sector growth, and a greater sense of cultural prerogative and confidence. These are not as easily measured as economic multipolarity, but some clear strands are emerging. To try to synthesize what a pole entails, we can point toward several initial factors: size of a country’s GDP, size of its population, the existence of an imperial legacy, the extent of its regional economic role, its military size and sophistication (e.g., absolute spending, number of fighter jets and ships), its place on the UN Human Development Index relative to its region, and its participation (or not) in a regional grouping (such as NATO or the European Union).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this schema the European Union, the United States, China, and potentially India are poles, but Japan and Russia would not qualify as distinct poles. Russia, for instance, scores well on certain aspects of multipolarity (e.g., militarily), but in its current state it may never become a true pole in the sense employed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path toward multipolarity will not be smooth. One tension is that since the Industrial Revolution the world has had an anchor point in terms of the locus and spread of globalization (Britain in the nineteenth century and the United States in the twentieth century). The fact that there are now at least three points of reference introduces a new and possibly uncertain dynamic to world affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential is high for friction, misunderstanding, and conflict among the increasingly different ways of doing things across the major poles. Essentially, multipolarity means that instead of speaking a common language, the major poles speak different policy languages. Trade-based tension is an obvious possibility here. Another form of tension is the crisis of identity created for countries that are not wholly within one of the poles—again, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom are the prime examples—and the crisis of ambition for countries, such as Russia, that want to be poles but lack the wherewithal to do so convincingly. At a more grassroots level, the implications of the end of globalization as we know it and the path to multipolarity will become a greater part of the political debate. At the margin, the flow of people, ideas, and capital may be less global and more regional and in time could be reinforced by a growing sense of regionalization across the main poles. In a negative way, a more multipolar world may be the watershed that signals the peak of democracy and potentially the beginning of contests within regions for competing views of democracy, institutional strength, statecraft, and control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_______________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpted from “The Levelling: What&amp;#x27;s Next After Globalization.” Copyright © 2019 by Michael O&amp;#x27;Sullivan.

Is the future one in which open societies with free markets vie for influence in global affairs with authoritarian countries under state capitalism? The very questions evoke a nostalgia for a seemingly simpler past. For Michael O’Sullivan, formerly an investment banker and economist at Princeton University, it is more useful to consider the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr O’Sullivan’s book, “The Levelling: What&amp;#x27;s Next After Globalisation” offers a roadmap. He sees a multipolar world forming but international institutions unprepared for this. He voices worries about a world of low growth and high debt—and calls for a “world treaty on risk” so central banks only resort to measures like quantitative easing under agreed conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his most intriguing framing of the issues is his comparison of today’s world and 17th century England’s Putney Debates, when the practicalities of a rights-based democracy were first enunciated by a faction called “ The Levellers” (which inspired the book’s title). The world, he believes, will cleave into “Leveller” countries that hew to rights and freedoms, and “Leviathan” ones that are content with state-managed growth and fewer liberties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future initiative, we probed Mr O’Sullivan ideas in a short interview. Below that is an excerpt from his book, on the end of globalisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: Describe what comes after globalisation—what does the world you foresee look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp501.jpg 200w,

We should say goodbye to it and set our minds on the emerging multipolar world. This will be dominated by at least three large regions: America, the European Union and a China-centric Asia. They will increasingly take very different approaches to economic policy, liberty, warfare, technology and society. Mid-sized countries like Russia, Britain, Australia and Japan will struggle to find their place in the world, while new coalitions will emerge, such as a “Hanseatic League 2.0” of small, advanced states like those of Scandinavia and the Baltics. Institutions of the 20th century—the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation—will appear increasingly defunct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: What killed globalisation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael O&amp;#x27;Sullivan: At least two things have put paid to globalisation. First, global economic growth has slowed, and as a result, the growth has become more “financialised”: debt has increased and there has been more “monetary activism”—that is, central banks pumping money into the economy by buying assets, such as bonds and in some cases even equities—to sustain the international expansion. Second, the side effects, or rather the perceived side-effects, of globalisation are more apparent: wealth inequality, the dominance of multinationals and the dispersion of global supply chains, which have all become hot political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: Was the death of globalisation inevitable or could (and should) it have been prevented?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr O&amp;#x27;Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt;: One problematic factor here is that there is no central body or authority to shape globalisation, beyond perhaps the World Economic Forum or maybe the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In many ways, the end of globalisation is marked by the poor and inconclusive response to the global financial crisis. In general, the response has been to cut the cost of capital and not to tackle the root causes of the crisis. As such, the world economy will limp on, burdened by debt and in hock to easy money from central banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: The book&amp;#x27;s title comes from the &amp;quot;Levellers&amp;quot; during Britain&amp;#x27;s Putney Debates in the mid 1600s. Who were they and what can their story teach us today? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr O&amp;#x27;Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt;: The Levellers are a hidden gem from British history. They were a mid 17th century group in England, who participated in debates about democracy that took place in a part of London called Putney. Their achievement was crafting “An Agreement of the People,” which were a series of manifestos that marked the first popular conceptions of what a constitutional democracy might look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Levellers are interesting for two reasons. First, in the context of the time, their approach was constructive and practical. The “Agreement” spells out what people want from those who govern them in a clear and tangible way. For example, they proposed term limits on political office and that laws regarding indebtedness are applied equally to the rich and poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they are interesting for the way the movement was countermanded and then snuffed out by the military leader Oliver Cromwell and the Grandees (the elites of their day). Like so many idealistic political start-ups, the Levellers failed. This should encourage the growing number of new political parties, like Change UK and new candidates to be worldy-wise in how they approach the process of political reform and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: You foresee new international institutions to replace archaic 20th-century ones that are suited for a different time. How would they work? And can countries with such different values (ie, democratic, market-based &amp;quot;Levellers&amp;quot; and state-managed societies and economies, the &amp;quot;Leviathans&amp;quot;) really cooperate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr O&amp;#x27;Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot is made of the Cold War rivalry between communist Russia and America, and now some want to see a clash of civilizations between America and China. The “Levelling” characterises a future where there are at least two approaches to public life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most distinctive approach to nations doing things in their own way will be for what the Levellers might call the “rights of freeborn men,” or the idea of the open society. The code of the Levellers presents a very clear political formula that Europeans and Americans will recognise for its values, though decreasingly in its practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge to this code will come from the rising acceptance of less democratic ways of ordering society, in both developed and developing countries. A related clash will be the desire of a growing proportion of electorates to have a more open society as economies also open up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world evolves along the lines of Leveller-type and Leviathan-type societies, it is possible that in some countries, such as Russia, a Leviathan-like approach—that is, order in exchange for reduced democracy and rights—will be the accepted way of life. In other countries, most interestingly China, as its economy loses momentum and evolves, there may be a growing tension between groups holding the Leviathan view (supported inevitably by Grandees) and opposing Leveller-like groups (who favor equality of opportunity and a multiparty system). The role and views of women, especially in China, and of minority groups like the gay community will be pivotal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of a new world order, based on large regions and coloured by Leveller and Leviathan modes of governance, echoes several periods in history. The challenge in the next few years will be for Leviathan-oriented nations like China to maintain economic stability so that rising unemployment, for instance, does not break the “Leviathan contract”. Equally, the challenge in Leveller countries will be to maintain open, fraternal societies in the face of political and potentially economic volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good-bye to Globalisation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpted from “The Levelling: What&amp;#x27;s Next After Globalization” by Michael O&amp;#x27;Sullivan (PublicAffairs, 2019).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190629_opp502.jpg 200w,

Many will resist and, like the thirty-five foreign-policy experts who published an advertisement in the New York Times on July 26, 2018, under the banner “Why We Should Preserve International Institutions and Order,” will feel that the existing world order and its institutions should be maintained. I disagree. Globalization, at least in the form that people have come to enjoy it, is defunct. From here, the passage away from globalization can take two new forms. One dangerous scenario is that we witness the outright end of globalization in much the same manner as the first period of globalization collapsed in 1913. This scenario is a favorite of commentators because it allows them to write about bloody end-of-the-world calamities. This is, thankfully, a low-probability outcome, and with apologies to the many armchair admirals in the commentariat who, for instance, talk willfully of a conflict in the South China Sea, I suggest that a full-scale sea battle between China and the United States is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the evolution of a new world order—a fully multipolar world composed of three (perhaps four, depending on how India develops) large regions that are distinct in the workings of their economies, laws, cultures, and security networks—is manifestly underway. My sense is that until 2018, multipolarity was a more theoretical concept—more something to write about than to witness. This is changing quickly: trade tensions, advances in technologies (such as quantum computing), and the regulation of technology are just some of the fissures around which the world is splitting into distinct regions. Multipolarity is gaining traction and will have two broad axes. First, the poles in the multipolar world have to be large in terms of economic, financial, and geopolitical power. Second, the essence of multipolarity is not simply that the poles are large and powerful but also that they develop distinct, culturally consistent ways of doing things. Multipolarity, where regions do things distinctly and differently, is also very different from multilateralism, where they do them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, in particular, is interesting in the context of the switch from globalization to multipolarity, not least because at the 2017 World Economic Forum the Chinese president claimed the mantle of globalization for China. China benefited greatly from globalization and its accoutrements (e.g., WTO membership), and it played a vital role in the supply-chain dynamic that drove globalization. However, trade flows into China increasingly betray a move away from a globalized world and toward a more regionally focused one. For instance, IMF data show that in 2018, compared with 2011, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Malaysia traded more with China and relatively less with the United States. These countries, together with Bangladesh and Pakistan, have allowed themselves to be enticed by trade- and investment-based relationships with China and are now in its orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, China is itself not globalized: it is increasingly hard for Western companies to do business there on equal terms with Chinese companies, and the flow of both money and ideas—out of and into China, respectively—is heavily curtailed. Flow of people is another indicator. Flows within China are dynamic and are perhaps more managed than before, but flows of foreigners into China are miniscule by comparison to other countries, and China has only recently established an agency (the State Immigration Administration created at the 2018 Party Congress) to cultivate inward flows. So as China has become a major pole, it has become less globalized and arguably is contributing to the trend toward deglobalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a broader scale, without picking on individual countries, we can measure the extent to which the world is becoming multipolar by examining aggregate trends in trade, GDP, foreign direct investment, government budget size, and population.

The 76-old former vice-president took a big lead in the race the moment he entered it—despite two lamentable previous presidential runs and rumours that he might lack the requisite energy for a third. His campaign’s subsequent efforts to shield him from reporters increased that suspicion. The debate in Miami, in which Mr Biden appeared alongside nine other candidates, was his first big opportunity to allay it. He failed that test so resoundingly that his performance was at times painful to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Biden’s campaign pledge is to take America back to how things were under Barack Obama, whose enduring popularity on the left, especially among non-white voters, is by far his biggest advantage. That and a feeling that his centre-leftishness would be a safer bet against Donald Trump than the fiery leftishness of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are currently in second and third place respectively, explains his lead in the polls. His potential disadvantages are that, as Democrats have moved to the left, those moderate Obama-era positions, on immigration, foreign policy, health care and so forth, are no longer so popular. The hard-left hates them. And Mr Biden may not be up to dealing with the brickbats this guarantees him. His lifelong prolixity has not improved with age. Where once he sounded unfocused, he now sometimes sounds befuddled. He can also sound strikingly incurious about the many ways America is changing—which in turn makes his status-quo-ante solutions appear complacent and out-of-touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those weaknesses were apparent in Miami from the start. He delivered semi-prepared answers on health care and foreign policy that were rambling and at times hard to follow. When the candidates were periodically asked to raise their hands if they agreed with one assertion or another—that crossing into America illegally should not be a crime, for example—he kept raising his halfway, as though he were unsure what he thought of the issue, or what the rules were , or maybe he was frail. A couple of his answers suggested he had not correctly heard the question. What would you do on your first day in the Oval Office, he was asked? “I would defeat Donald Trump!” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These difficulties made Mr Biden’s frequent recourse to trumpeting his connection to Mr Obama sound evasive at best. The debate also showed how vulnerable he is, as a result of his decades-long career and frequent gaffs, to attacks on his record. Senator Kamala Harris, one of his main rivals for all-important African-American voters, eviscerated him over his long-ago opposition to integrating schools by ‘bussing” in black pupils—and for his recent fond reflections on what it was like to work alongside old-style Democratic segregationists. Adding insult to injury, she contrasted Mr Biden’s apparent carelessness towards minority sensibilities with a memory of the racism she had faced as a mixed-race child in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performances of Ms Harris and Pete Buttigieg, Mr Biden’s two closest rivals on the stage after Mr Sanders, were indeed more bad news for the former vice-president. Both were impressive, with the debate format playing to Ms Harris’s strengths especially. A former prosecutor, she has courtroom presence (she knows how to grab attention by slowing down her speech where others speed up). And—as she showed in her exchange with Mr Biden—she thrives on the cut and thrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been less impressive on the trail; she seems overly cautious and unable to give a clear sense of her politics. That is a failing she appeared to repeat, rather ludicrously, during the debate. When the candidates were asked who among them would abolish private health-care insurance, she joined Mr Sanders in raising her hand. This was a hard-left position she had previously claimed to support in a television interview, but then rowed back from. The fact that she was now readopting it looked like the biggest policy news of the night. Immediately after the debate, however, Ms Harris said she had again made a mistake. That would again be a sensible course correction: the policy looks like a general-election loser. More broadly, however, Ms Harris’s strong showing confirms an impression that she may be the candidate most likely to gain if Mr Biden slides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Buttigieg could also gain. His performance showed what a rare talent the upstart mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is. Unlike Mr Biden, he was able to make pragmatism sound interesting. More important than any candidate’s health-care policy is how they intend to achieve it, he said. He also dealt skilfully with a potentially damaging controversy he is mired in back in South Bend—a police killing that has turned members of the city’s black community against him. “It’s a mess, and we’re hurting,” he acknowledged. Asked why the city’s police force remains overwhelmingly white, despite his efforts to introduce more diversity, he grimaced and said, it was “because I couldn’t get it done.” Besides being appealing, Mr Buttigieg’s modesty is tactically useful. It makes him hard to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Sanders put in a quieter performance. Apparently more vigorous than Mr Biden—whom he is older than by a year—the democratic socialist remains an effective debater of his own left-wing economic policy ideas. And he has a clear message—on the inequities of the system and the need for massive spending schemes to fix them— that a sizeable minority of Democrats want to hear. But there are not enough of them to win the primary. Mr Sanders success in 2016 (not that he ever seriously threatened to beat Hillary Clinton) was based on attracting voters who were chiefly repelled by his establishment rival, and they have a greater array of alternatives this time around. He has been sliding in the polls, most conspicuously to the benefit of Mrs Warren and Mr Buttigieg. He probably cannot win without broadening his message and appeal: his debate performance showed how unlikely that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next big question concerns whether Mr Biden will actually suffer for his poor performance. It is hard to imagine he will not. The former vice-president simply does not look like the safe bet many Democratic voters appear to want. Then again, he never really has. Perhaps he will maintain his lead. Whether he does or not, however, it is hard to be relaxed about the Democrats’ chances of beating Donald Trump in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of a major economic downturn, centre-left moderation still looks like the likeliest means to winning a general election next year. And Mr Biden is currently a poor proponent of it. None of the other avowedly moderate candidates looks competitive—including, on the stage in Miami, Senator Michael Bennet, who offered further evidence that he is smart and sensible; just not charismatic. Meanwhile, Mr Biden’s closest rivals—Mr Sanders, Mr Warren and Ms Harris—have all, to varying degrees, rejected moderation altogether. That may turn out to be the most important takeaway from this week’s opening debates. Unless, that is, Ms Harris really didn’t mean the hard-left shift on health-care policy that she appeared to signal. Hopefully she didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 15:40:29 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Supreme Court blocks a citizenship question on the 2020 census]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/06/27/the-supreme-court-blocks-a-citizenship-question-on-the-2020-census]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190629_USP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-27T23:27:29Z&quot;&gt;Jun 28th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;READING the first 25 pages of Chief Justice John Roberts’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-966_bq7c.pdf&quot;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Department of Commerce v New York,&lt;/em&gt; one gets the impression he sided with the Trump administration in its quest to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Indeed, on most of the contested legal questions, the court agreed with the government. But in the final three pages, the chief, joined by the court’s four liberal justices, issued a rebuke to Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who was responsible for the change. The stakes of the ruling are enormous: population data from the decennial census are used to determine the number of representatives—and therefore electoral votes—allocated to each state. A severe undercount of Hispanics, as opponents of the administration feared, might dilute the political representation of blue states like California; some red states, like Texas, would also be affected. The data also determine the flow of billions of dollars in government cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to add the question “cannot be adequately explained” by the official justification—gathering improved citizenship data to enforce the Voting Rights Act—Chief Justice Roberts wrote. There is a “significant mismatch” between Mr Ross&amp;#x27;s decision to add the query and “the rationale he provided”. If the government wants to ask census-takers if they are citizens, it needs to come up with a justification that is “reasoned”, not “contrived”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the agency takes up the Supreme Court’s offer to rejig its rationale for adding the citizenship question, it has fewer legal hurdles to clear. Chief Justice Roberts saw to that in the previous sections of his opinion. First, there is no constitutional bar to the question in Article I of the constitution, as the challengers had claimed. The requirement that Congress conduct an “actual enumeration” of people living in America every ten years, the court concluded, is not violated when the government knows that a new question will decrease response rates. So even though government experts warn that the query would scare off many Hispanic households, resulting in an undercount of some 6.5m people, the decision to ask it is not unconstitutional on those grounds. Second, the court decided that Mr Ross did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in adding the question to the decennial census rather than rely on administrative records to gather citizenship data. When Judge Jesse Furman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/2019-01-15-574-Findings%20Of%20Fact.pdf&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; otherwise in his district-court ruling last year, he “improperly substituted [his] judgment for that of the agency”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the opinion’s final section—described by the other four conservative justices as “regrettable” (Samuel Alito) and reflecting “the din of suspicion and distrust that seems to typify modern discourse” (Clarence Thomas)—Chief Justice Roberts explained why he doubted the sincerity of Mr Ross’s stated rationale. Though Mr Ross claimed he started pondering the citizenship question after only a week in his position, the record “contains no hint that he was considering” voting rights of minorities as the impetus. The “sole stated reason” for the change, the court found, “seems to have been contrived”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/06/26/the-justices-vote-5-4-to-uphold-donald-trumps-travel-ban&quot;&gt;deferring&lt;/a&gt; to Donald Trump’s reasons for barring travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, Chief Justice Roberts drew a line in the sand. The Supreme Court must be “deferential” to administrative decisions, he wrote, but “we cannot ignore the disconnect between the decision made and the explanation given”. Nor should the justices display overweening “naiveté”. Agencies must provide “genuine justifications”, not pretexts, “for important decisions”. While “reasoned decision-making...calls for an explanation for agency action”, Mr Ross offered a mere “distraction”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been little reason to see the Trump administration’s stated justification for the citizenship question as anything but a ruse. As Justice Elena Kagan put it at the hearing on April 23rd—foreshadowing the ruling on June 27th—“you can’t really read this record” and conclude that the rationale was anything but “contrived”. More recently, it emerged, from files found on his hard drive, that Thomas Hofeller, a late Republican strategist, had played a central role in the decision to add the citizenship question and in drafting a memo laying out the Voting Rights Act as the rationale. His aim was to gather citizenship data so that Republicans could more effectively gerrymander electoral maps in their favour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This came to light after the census case was briefed and argued, and thus could not factor into the court’s decision. But that did not stop the parties from dispatching a flurry of notes to the justices requesting, and arguing against, a re-opening of the case in the district court in the weeks leading up to the ruling. Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion has the feel of a brokered compromise—it even reads as if the final section may have been added or revised late in the process. It is impossible to know if the new evidence reported in the media affected the chief’s move. He seems to have changed his mind before in an explosive case—the Obamacare challenge in 2012—as Joan Biskupic recounts in her recent biography of the chief justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens now? The commerce department gets another go at coming up with a justification for including the citizenship question. That might be a tall order, but Chief Justice Roberts’s opinion suggests that as long as it is genuine, it could pass muster. That is true even if the justification is crassly political: “A court may not set aside an agency’s policymaking decision”, the decision reads, “solely because it might have been influenced by political considerations or prompted by an administration’s priorities”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is another wrinkle: a new case, arising from Mr Hofeller’s files, claiming the citizenship question targets Hispanics and therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A ruling from the federal court in Maryland could take a while, as could an appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime a preliminary injunction could stymie the citizenship question—even if the government supplies an adequate reason for the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear exactly how much time there is left to resolve all of this. The government originally said it needed to finalise the questionnaire to begin printing the census on July 1st; if that is the case, the citizenship question is doomed. But other documents show October 31st as the real deadline, which would give the courts a few more months to work everything out. In a tweet on June 27th, Donald Trump expressed displeasure with the ruling and said he has asked &amp;quot;the lawyers&amp;quot; if the census can be delayed &amp;quot;no matter how long&amp;quot;. The answer—&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;—is in the constitution: the census must be conducted &amp;quot;within every...term of ten years&amp;quot;. (The timing is also defined by congressional statute.) It remains to be seen whether citizenship will appear on the 2020 census, but the Supreme Court&amp;#x27;s decision is certainly a blow to the Trump administration’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 06:40:39 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Curing the big sea]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/27/curing-the-big-sea]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190629_blm512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-27T17:30:13Z&quot;&gt;Jun 27th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESEARCHERS HOPE to use disease-fighting genes found in whales to help find treatments for cancer in humans.

With an estimated value of about $200trn, homes are collectively worth about three times as much as all publicly traded shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charts above track housing-market indicators across 28 countries, in some instances going as far back as 1970. The first two metrics are price indices, one expressed in nominal terms and another adjusted for inflation. The second two measure valuation: one compares house prices with their long-run relationship with individual incomes, and the other with the historical ratio of home values to rents. If house prices climb faster than either earnings or rent payments for a long period of time, a housing bubble may be forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this basis, house prices appear to be on an unsustainable path in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Ten years ago they reached similarly dizzying heights against rents and incomes in Spain, Ireland and some American cities, only to endure a brutal collapse.

Since then, ultra-low interest rates and an increasing abundance of credit have pushed house prices back towards or beyond their pre-crisis peaks. As a result, in some markets policymakers are beginning to worry that boom could once again turn to bust. The long housing rally in Australia is coming to an abrupt end: prices there fell 8% in the year to the end of March. Appreciation has also slowed markedly in Britain, Canada and New Zealand during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could another crash lurk on the horizon? To estimate this risk, The Economist has created a statistical prediction model for house prices. It uses data on macroeconomic conditions, market fundamentals and historical home values to peer 18 months into the future. As an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/29/for-now-residential-property-prices-are-likely-to-keep-rising&quot; data-tegid=&quot;1rllrnkjn37phsjkgnlph7s5hg4jm56m&quot;&gt;article in our print edition&lt;/a&gt; this week shows, the model performs well when back-tested against the past. Although it would not have anticipated the magnitude of the extreme boom and bust of the mid-2000s, it would have foreseen a sharp reversal in the trend. For example, ahead of the financial crisis, when prices were growing at 8% a year in America, our model would have expected house-price growth to slow to just 0.3% a year 18 months later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the model is currently rather sanguine about the likely paths for home values across ten rich world countries, thanks to the persistence of low interest rates and ample credit. The average of its median forecasts for price growth in the year to the end of June 2020 is 2.3%. The model expects prices in Australia to level off rather than continuing to decline. Only in Italy are values more likely to fall than to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-infographic-&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-interactive-&gt;Sources: OECD; BIS; IMF; national statistics; &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-infographic-js=&quot;/2019/house-price-forecast/js/bundle.js&quot; data-infographic-css=&quot;/2019/house-price-forecast/css/style.css&quot;&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://infographics.economist.com/2019/house-price-forecast/css/style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure data-infographic-css=&quot;/2018/site-fixes/style.css&quot;&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://infographics.economist.com/2018/site-fixes/style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2019 23:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
