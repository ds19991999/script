The army of undead White Walkers has been defeated. The Iron Throne has melted. After eight seasons “Game of Thrones”, HBO’s biggest-ever show, came to an end on May 19th. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/17/how-unprecedented-is-the-decline-of-game-of-thrones&quot;&gt;last series caused fury&lt;/a&gt; among devoted fans, with more than 1m people signing a petition to have the season redrafted by “more competent” screenwriters. Some, given the chance, might make the producers re-enact the “walk of shame” suffered by Cersei Lannister, a key character, in season five (she was made to pass through a crowd naked while being pelted with rotten fruit). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard not to feel some sympathy for David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the showrunners. As anyone who has read the books can attest, George R.R. Martin constructed an enormous, sprawling story with a bewildering cast of characters and a weird mix of politics, sex, gory violence and magic. It was never going to be easy to tie these elements together to make a satisfactory ending. Mr Martin has amply demonstrated that himself. He published the first book in 1996 and the fifth (of a planned seven) in 2011, but is yet to complete the saga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy should not overshadow the show’s success in creating an unmissable cultural event. “Game of Thrones” was the kind of series that schoolchildren would discuss at break time and office workers would chat about by the kettle. Critics devoted thousands of words to finding hidden clues and unpicking symbolism. Children were named after the central characters—a decision parents would often come to regret—and President Donald Trump used the imagery of the series to illustrate his political messages. In the binge-watching era, viewers waited patiently for each week’s instalment; fans outside America were forced into drastic action to avoid spoilers on social media. (Note to Twitter: there is no point allowing users to mute words when you list spoilers in the “Trending” column.) And, of course, the series inspired a subculture of those who proudly proclaim that they never watched an episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What explains the show’s success? A crucial component came from the books: Mr Martin’s willingness to kill off important characters. Sean Bean was the biggest star of the first series and, as the noble Ned Stark, seemed set to be the hero of the saga. But he was executed early on, while his wife and son were dispatched in the “Red Wedding” bloodbath in season three. Ever since no character has seemed safe. Viewers have been kept in a state of nervous tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the political struggle at the heart of the series had broader resonance. Mr Martin based his saga loosely on the Wars of the Roses in England in the 15th century, when rival families battled for the throne. But it is not hard to find echoes of the 20th century too, with the Starks as the English, complete with Northern accents, and the blond, ruthless Lannisters as the Germans. The latter could only be defeated by bringing in the forces of the “new world”, as represented by Daenerys and her dragons. Victory was achieved but only at a terrible cost; the destruction by fire of King’s Landing in the final series, which could be compared with the bombing of Dresden, or Hiroshima. Another theme, manifest in the oft-repeated warning “winter is coming”, was climate change. For much of the series, the rival families ignored (and indeed ridiculed) the threat posed by the White Walkers, an invading army from the frozen north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, the series was a meditation on the nature of leadership. Ned Stark’s noble honesty was shown to be too naive; the callous rule of the Lannisters meant their subjects showed them no loyalty; the messianic appeal of Daenerys led the character to morph into a fanatical dictator. In some cases, the characters lost all morality in their pursuit of the Iron Throne, as best demonstrated when Stannis Baratheon burned his daughter alive in a desperate attempt to boost his chances. Alas, the show eventually awarded the kingdom to its single most irritating character, Bran Stark, a crippled boy who spoke only in fortune-cookie aphorisms. The only redeeming feature of this denouement was that Bran was shown to be a figurehead, guided by the show’s best character, Tyrion, the hard-drinking, wise-cracking dwarf played by Peter Dinklage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the best way of explaining the show’s success was that it was an elaborate soap opera, in the style of “Dallas” or “Dynasty”, two series that also featured battling families. Like those shows, “Game of Thrones” had larger-than-life heroes and villains, whom viewers could cheer and boo from the sidelines. Soap operas are designed never to end and “Game of Thrones” fans would only have been happy, one suspects, if the series had been extended by a final twist, so their favourite characters could bicker and conspire for a few more years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is, there are various prequels in the works. The decision of one of the Stark children, Arya, to set sail for unknown lands to the west suggests the possibility of a spin-off that echoes Europe’s colonial expansion in the 16th century. But it will be a miracle if any show can make the same cultural impact as “Game of Thrones”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 21:40:33 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Daniel Hahn on the art of translation]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/05/21/daniel-hahn-on-the-art-of-translation]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_BKP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-21T12:36:59Z&quot;&gt;May 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR A long time, translators had a hard time of it. They were underpaid and under-recognised by the literary establishment, rarely mentioned in reviews of the titles they worked on. But as foreign fiction has gained popularity—according to Nielsen BookScan, a data provider, Britons spent £20.7m ($26.6m) on it in 2018, up from £16.9m in 2014—so too has the profile of translators increased. In 2016 the Man Booker prize announced that its International award, of £50,000, would be shared by author and translator. The National Book Awards in America reintroduced a category for translated literature last year. That prize money, of $10,000, is also divided equally.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, a new breed of translator has emerged: confident, vocal and media-savvy. Jennifer Croft, who won the Man Booker International prize last year for her translation of Olga Tokarczuk’s “Flights”, is one such figure: she began translating Ms Tokarczuk’s work while still studying at the University of Iowa, and has written extensively about translation in the press and in her own publication, the &lt;em&gt;Buenos Aires Review&lt;/em&gt;. There’s also Sophie Hughes, a former translation correspondent for &lt;em&gt;Dazed &amp;amp; Confused&lt;/em&gt; magazine, whose work on “La Resta” (“The Remainder”), Alia Trabucco Zerán’s novel, was shortlisted for the Man Booker International prize this year. Daniel Hahn, a translator of Portuguese, Spanish and French, is another prominent figure. His translation of Angolan writer José Eduardo Agualusa’s “A General Theory of Oblivion” was shortlisted for the Man Booker in 2016 and won the International Dublin Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Hahn, who was raised in London by an Argentinian father and a Brazilian mother, started out as an author of non-fiction before realising that he was drawn to translation. He has worked on everything from Pelé’s autobiography to children’s picture-books. The first misapprehension about translators, Mr Hahn says, is that they are all brilliant linguists. “I think a lot of people assume that language familiarity is on a spectrum from knowing nothing to being fluent, and actually it’s a lot more complex and interesting than that. You can, as in my case, be a very good and comfortable consumer of a language and a very poor producer of that language.” It’s more important, he reckons, to be a subtle and intelligent writer of the language you are translating into than to possess perfect fluency. “I read Portuguese and Spanish very comfortably, I speak them badly, I can’t write them at all, because of the way I happened to acquire the languages. The same with French.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each translator has their own approach to the work, though Mr Hahn describes his method as “not untypical”. He begins without first having read the book, “so the process of translating the novel is also that process of discovering what’s happening”. “It’s partly that I want to have the experience of the average reader, where you’re driven forward by wanting to know what happens next,” he says, “but it’s also the absolutely ideal way of faking being a writer, because I’m also starting from nothing and writing right through to the end without any doubt.” While Mr Hahn writes journalism and has several non-fiction books to his name, he says he never had any wish to write novels. “Translating becomes a sort of replicating of an idealised version of that writing experience, so that I can write a novel as if it’s from scratch, but I know it’s going to work because it’s been road-tested in another language. I’m constantly writing these great novels, which is an amazing privilege.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the question of how much a translator “writes” the novel is a loaded one. Deborah Smith’s translation of Han Kang’s “The Vegetarian” won the Man Booker International Prize in 2016, but several journalists and academics criticised Ms Smith for what they saw as divergences from the original Korean (one study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07374836.2018.1437098?scroll=top&amp;amp;amp;needAccess=true&amp;amp;amp;journalCode=utrv20&quot;&gt;argued that&lt;/a&gt; 10.9% of the first part of the novel was mistranslated). Responding to the furore in the &lt;em&gt;LA Review of Books&lt;/em&gt;, Ms Smith countered these accusations of undue “creativity” by stating that “since there is no such thing as a truly literal translation—no two languages’ grammars match, their vocabularies diverge, even punctuation has a different weight—there can be no such thing as a translation that is not ‘creative’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Hahn agrees that the idea of total fidelity to the original text is impossible. “I don’t think there’s any question that we want to be faithful,” he says, but “the question is what we are choosing to be faithful to. Sometimes you’re being faithful to the spirit of the book in ways that are quite profound and subtle and have very little to do with meaning.” But the act of translation is about alchemy, not inserting yourself into the text. “I have no self-expression that needs to be fulfilled through this process. That’s not how translation works,” he says. “I have a desire for someone else to be able to express themselves via me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He translates, he says, in order to broaden readers’ horizons—“so that people can read this great book from Angola or Brazil or wherever”—and open up new literary possibilities. “Unless the reader learns Portuguese, they won’t be able to experience this wonderful book, and so I’m presenting it to them, just not with the same words.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The winners of the Man Booker International Prize 2019 will be announced on May 21st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 21:40:32 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The global battle over high drug prices]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/21/the-global-battle-over-high-drug-prices]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_wbp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-21T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THESE DAYS it is hard to find a government that is not struggling with the high price of medicines. In England, the government is fighting Vertex, a drug company, over the cost of a drug for cystic fibrosis, Orkambi. In America, diabetics have died because of the high cost of insulin. In the Netherlands, the government for a time stopped buying the immuno-oncology drug, Keytruda, because it was too expensive—even though it had helped to develop it. The list price of Orkambi is about $23,000 a month in America, and Keytruda is about $13,600 month (for as long as treatment continues). It has taken such rich-world dramas to force the unaffordability of medicines to the top of the agenda, even though poorer countries have complained about it for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 20th governments started tackling the issue at the World Health Assembly (WHA), an eight-day policy forum where health ministers define the goals for the World Health Organisation for the coming year. There is a lot for them to discuss, including the expansion of universal health care, antimicrobial resistance, the impact of climate change on health and the deepening crisis of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Yet the hottest topic is the high price of new medicines, particularly cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February the Italian health minister, Giulia Grillo, published a draft resolution on drug pricing. It calls for international action to improve the transparency of prices and R&amp;amp;D costs, as well as the costs of production of medicines. Firms will also be asked to divulge all the different forms of government support they receive. These may range from venture-capital funds and start-up financing to tax incentives and even research conducted by academics. The hope is that greater clarity should lower drug prices. The Italian proposal is backed by many countries, rich and poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical companies currently publish only list prices. These are large, somewhat fictional numbers that are subject to being bargained down. Just how big a discount governments, insurers and other middlemen can secure is confidential. Many have concluded that all the secrecy is putting those who pay for the drugs at a disadvantage. Els Torreele of Médecins Sans Frontières, an NGO, says that different buyers—even those in the same country—can be charged widely differing prices. “Prices are kept secret and buyers are asked to sign confidential agreements,” she says. And despite the fact that, in theory, poor countries might be charged less than rich ones, there are concerns that the reverse may in fact be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug firms are not pleased. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations told Stat, a medical-news website, that the draft resolution would “divert attention and resources from finding sustainable solutions to access”. Britain, Germany and Denmark are trying to water down the proposal, probably under pressure from their large pharma industries—even though they are all facing growing drug-pricing problems at home. Pharma companies have long argued that the costs and risks of developing a drug warrant high prices. They argue that greater price transparency will mean that poor countries will no longer get good deals, because firms will not want to undermine their ability to extract high prices from wealthier states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the degree to which poor countries get favourable treatment is usually unknown, except for some high-profile cases: vaccines, perhaps, and antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV infections. The WHO estimates that 100m people fall into poverty annually owing to the prices they pay for medicines. Moreover, there is evidence that the prices charged for some drugs are, indeed, unreasonably high. A WHO report at the end of 2018, on cancer medicines, concluded that companies priced their drugs largely according to their expectations of income, rather than what the drug cost to make or how to maximise access to patients. That a firm is making as much profit as possible is, perhaps, unremarkable. However, drug firms are not ordinary companies. Their products are needed to save lives, and they obtain monopolies on their drugs through patent systems granted by governments and, by extension, society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO also found that, even acknowledging the high cost of developing drugs, cancer medicines are generating returns far in excess of the R&amp;amp;D costs, and far more than is necessary to finance and create incentives for future efforts. It also appears that cancer drugs are more expensive than other medicines—seemingly because buyers are willing to pay more to treat terminal conditions. Australian data show that the cost per prescription for cancer drugs is at least 2.5 times higher than for other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharma industry generates large profits. In America, 12 of the country’s most profitable drug companies reported more than $29bn in profits in the first quarter of this year, according to Axios, a news website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates argue that transparency will allow people to judge whether governments have made good decisions about the medicines that they buy. In countries with weak governance, more transparent pricing should help to combat corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America has made drug-pricing transparency a priority recently, and drug-makers must now disclose their list prices even on television advertisements. (List prices are important to patients because they may have to pay a proportion of this sum themselves.) Whatever the outcome this week at the WHA, pharma companies will face growing demands to come clean about the cost of life-saving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 21:40:31 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The coming Eurosceptic surge in the European Parliament]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/21/the-coming-eurosceptic-surge-in-the-european-parliament]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_woc965.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-21T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT has been dominated by a coalition of centre-right and centre-left parties since direct elections began in 1979. Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy’s right-wing Northern League party, sees this as a problem: he pledges to “free Europe” from Brussels’ domination. To that end, he has gathered a new alliance of Eurosceptic nationalist parties into what he hopes will be “a governing force and force for change”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest polls, he may be disappointed. The current forecast suggests his coalition, the European Alliance of People and Nations, will come fourth in the vote, which takes place on May 23rd-26th. Even though nationalist parties are predicted to make significant gains since the last elections in 2014—winning an additional 61 seats in the 751-seat parliament to give Eurosceptic groups a combined 179 seats—this will not be enough to break the grip of the mainstream pro-EU “families”. They include the centre-right European People’s Party, the centre-left Socialists and Democrats group and the liberal Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem for Mr Salvini is that the Eurosceptics are disunited: two other, smaller, anti-EU groups will sit in the next parliament. Another difficulty is that pro-European voices are also rising. ALDE is set to increase its share substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centre-left parties are seeing their support collapse across Europe—especially in Italy, France, and Germany—but only in Italy are nationalists the clear beneficiaries. In Britain, the ruling Conservative Party is set for a humiliation as it trails in fourth position. The biggest winner will be the new Brexit Party of Nigel Farage, but its gains appear to come mostly from the Eurosceptic UKIP, the winner of the election in 2014, which he once led. Whereas UKIP MEPs have mostly joined Mr Salvini’s alliance, the Brexit Party is a member of the rival Eurosceptic grouping, Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Salvini’s Northern League is set to account for about half of net Eurosceptic gains in the new parliament. Nationalists certainly feel the wind at their backs. The European Parliament will become more fractious. Eurosceptics’ gains may change political dynamics in their home countries, notably in Britain and Italy. More broadly, they are pushing some mainstream parties into becoming more hostile towards the EU. But they will find it hard to change directly the way business is conducted within the EU’s institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 21:40:30 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“Roe v Wade will be slowly and steadily chipped away”—abortion in America]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/21/roe-v-wade-will-be-slowly-and-steadily-chipped-away-abortion-in-america]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/abortion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-21T11:30:04Z&quot;&gt;May 21st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE STRICT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/05/16/alabamas-lawmakers-want-to-challenge-roe-v-wade&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anti-abortion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bills cropping up in several American states are not expected to become the law of the land—but proponents want them to chip away at &lt;em&gt;Roe v Wade&lt;/em&gt;, which is.

In a lengthy Twitter thread Mr Amash argued that Mr Trump’s conduct had met the constitutional standard for impeachment—and that William Barr, the attorney-general, had “misled the public” about the special counsel’s findings over the president’s apparent “high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While impeachment should be undertaken only in extraordinary circumstances, the risk we face in an environment of extreme partisanship is not that Congress will employ it as a remedy too often but rather that Congress will employ it so rarely that it cannot deter misconduct,” wrote Mr Amash. He added that few members of Congress had read the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Amash, who in 2010 became the youngest member of Congress when he was elected in the Tea Party wave that crashed over America, has been a rare Republican critic of Mr Trump. In 2016, shortly after Mr Trump was elected, Mr Amash accused him of having an “extra-constitutional” view of presidency. “He seems to believe that government works like a business and he is the CEO of the business, and that is not how it works,” he said. A staunch libertarian—Mr Amash co-founded the House Freedom Caucus to represent small-government Tea Partiers on the Hill—he has openly disagreed with Mr Trump on other matters, including the president’s declaration of a national emergency earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Mr Trump enjoying an approval rating among Republicans of 90%, Mr Amash is unlikely to receive the backing of any of his Republican colleagues. Some quickly attacked Mr Amash. “What he wants is attention in this process,” said Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader. “He’s not a criminal attorney. He’s never met Mueller. He’s never met Barr. And now he’s coming forward with this?” (Mr Amash is an attorney; meeting the special counsel, let alone the attorney-general, is not a precondition for taking a view of Mr Mueller’s conclusions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Trump also accused Mr Amash of attention-seeking. He was “never a fan,” he tweeted, of the “total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great Republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was left to the Democrats (aside from a few Never Trump Republican exiles in the media) to hail Mr Amash’s courage. His move comes as a boost to those in the opposition party who are pushing, against the wishes of their party leaders, to begin impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump. Nancy Pelosi, the House majority leader, has said such a process would have to be bipartisan. Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic congresswoman from Michigan, who has formally submitted her own impeachment resolution, invited Mr Amash to join her. “You are putting country first and that is to be commended,” she tweeted. “We both took an oath to uphold the US constitution”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent further support from other Republicans, Mr Amash’s move is unlikely to make impeachment proceedings any more likely. Mrs Pelosi continues to believe that trying and failing to impeach Mr Trump would inflict grave electoral damage on her party in 2020. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, said at the weekend that “what may be pushing us in the direction of impeachment…has less to do with Justin Amash and more to do with the fact that the administration is engaging in a maximum obstructionism campaign against Congress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likeliest consequence for Mr Amash is that he will lose his seat, in Michigan’s third congressional district. On May 19th, Jim Lower, a state representative, said he would challenge Mr Amash in next year’s Republican primary. “I am a Pro-Trump, Pro-Life, Pro-Jobs, Pro-2nd Amendment, Pro-Family Values Republican,” he said. “Justin Amash’s tweets yesterday calling for President Trump’s impeachment show how out of touch he is with the truth and how out of touch he is with people he represents.” He told the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; he had not read the Mueller report in as much detail as Mr Amash had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The budding primary contest could emerge as test of whether Republicans critical of Mr Trump can still win elections. Alternatively, Mr Amash may have his eye on a bigger prize. He is reportedly considering a 2020 run against Mr Trump as a Libertarian candidate. He might not need to do particularly well to create a problem for the president. As a hardline conservative, he could take the votes of disaffected Republicans. Even if he only performed well at home in Michigan, a crucial swing state that Mr Trump won by a whisker in 2016, it could undo Mr Trump’s chances of re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I never stop thinking about these sorts of things,” Mr Amash told CNN earlier this year. “It&amp;#x27;s not because I have any immediate plans or anything like that, but I never stop thinking about those things because there is a big problem with the current two-party system we have, and someone has to shake it up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 11:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Brooks Koepka saves his best work for a major yet again]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/05/20/brooks-koepka-saves-his-best-work-for-a-major-yet-again]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190518_BLP505.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-20T21:00:01Z&quot;&gt;May 20th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SOMETIMES THE majors are the easiest ones to win,” Brooks Koepka said last week. “Half the people shoot themselves out of it, and mentally I know I can beat most of them.” It sounded like a preposterous boast. The four major championships in men’s golf feature virtually all of the world’s best players, making them vastly harder to win than weekly tour events against comparatively soft competition are. But five days later, Mr Koepka proved himself right. After prevailing in the PGA Championship on May 19th, he has now won four of the past eight majors he has entered (and four of 22 overall). In contrast, outside of the majors, he has amassed just five other titles through 122 tournaments on top-tier tours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Koepka’s victory appeared preordained for most of the event. Its organisers ensured that he would be in the spotlight from his very first shot by putting him in a playing group with Tiger Woods, still the sport’s biggest star, and Francesco Molinari. Between them, that trio held the non-calendar-year grand slam: Mr Koepka was the reigning U.S. Open and PGA Championship victor, Mr Molinari won Britain’s Open Championship in July and Mr Woods triumphed at the Masters last month. Moreover, each member of the group had suffered at least one close loss to another during those four events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the résumés of his playing partners, Mr Koepka blew them away—along with everyone else. He shot a course-record 63 in the first round on the notoriously difficult Bethpage Black Course, and followed it up with a sterling 65 in the second. With booming drives that regularly left Mr Woods’s and Mr Molinari’s balls 30 yards in the rearview mirror; pinpoint approach shots that honed in on flagsticks like laser-guided missiles; and putts whose lines never seemed to waver; Mr Koepka seemed to be playing a different game from his rivals. The last time a golfer looked that dominant may have been the heyday of Mr Woods, Mr Koepka’s playing partner, who wound up missing the cut just five weeks after he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/04/14/tiger-woods-wins-his-fifth-masters-in-a-comeback-for-the-ages&quot;&gt;beat Mr Koepka by one stroke at the Masters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Koepka would go on to need almost all seven strokes of the lead he had amassed at the tournament’s halfway mark. He completed the third round in a steady, even-par 70, preserving a seven-stroke advantage going into the final day. Upon reaching the back nine on Sunday, however, he came dangerously close to earning a spot on the list of golf’s most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/07/28/spectacular-golfing-collapses&quot;&gt;epic collapses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of errant tee shots—some captured by the fast-gusting wind, some simply mis-hit—resulted in a ghastly run of four consecutive bogeys on the 11th through 14th holes. Meanwhile, Dustin Johnson, the world’s top-ranked player at the start of the tournament, birdied the 15th after playing the front nine in three under par. For a moment, Mr Koepka’s lead had dwindled to a single stroke. At that point, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://eagle.economist.com&quot;&gt;EAGLE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;’s golf-forecasting system, gave Mr Johnson a 37% chance of completing a comeback victory—an outcome that had seemed unthinkable just an hour earlier. Had Mr Koepka’s back-nine jitters befallen anyone but a three-time major winner, fans and pundits would surely have called him a choker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Koepka never re-discovered his early-round magic after that point. He gave back another stroke with a bogey on the 17th hole, and flirted with disaster on the 18th by propelling his final tee shot into the gallery. But Mr Johnson could not sustain his momentum, over-shooting the green on the 16th hole and missing a seven-foot putt on the 17th to record back-to-back bogeys of his own. With a Houdini-like recovery to save par on the 18th, Mr Koepka staggered into the clubhouse with a four-over-par 74—and a second consecutive inscription on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/us-pga-the-incredible-story-of-the-wanamaker-trophy&quot;&gt;Wanamaker Trophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A major conundrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as the record books are concerned, a major win is a major win is a major win. Just 19 other players can match Mr Koepka’s four titles on golf’s biggest stages. And at just 29 years of age, he has plenty of time to move further up the list. Moreover, although Mr Koepka’s near-collapse in the final hours of the PGA Championship may taint fans’ memories of his triumph, he deserves credit for his sublime play during the first two rounds, which allowed him to weather the coming storm. Overall, he beat the average score of players making the cut by a healthy 14.5 strokes, a sufficiently large margin to win a major most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Mr Koepka’s self-inflicted close call demonstrated the occasionally erratic character that caused both &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/Golf/2019-pga-championship-predictions/QK92JN8HRC92GY2Q&quot;&gt;other statistical forecasters&lt;/a&gt; to preach caution on his chances. It would be an exaggeration to describe Mr Koepka as golf’s version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: he has no shortage of top-five and top-ten finishes outside of major competition. But the gap between his merely-strong work on the weekly grind and his otherworldly performances in majors remains a remarkable anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Mr Koepka first entered the top 100 of the official world rankings, the average of his 409 round scores outside of major play corresponds to a performance 0.88 strokes above par per round in a typical modern major environment. That is roughly the level one would expect from a player ranked between 20th and 25th in the world. In contrast, his average showing across 77 major rounds (after adjusting for course difficulty) comes to 0.75 strokes &lt;i&gt;below&lt;/i&gt; par per 18 holes—a threshold exceeded in modern times across majors and non-majors alike only by Mr Woods. The difference between those two figures, of 1.63 strokes per round, is the largest of any player with at least 25 rounds played in both majors and non-majors while in the top 100 since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could such a large discrepancy really be a mere statistical fluke? It would stand to reason that some players might prepare the same way for every tournament, whereas others might devote extra effort when the biggest prizes are on the line. Moreover, quality of competition is not the only difference between majors and other events. In addition, the organisers of major tournaments typically choose and prepare the courses in order to provide an unusually difficult test. And powerful golfers, exemplified by the chiselled Mr Koepka, may have playing styles that are particularly well-suited to the souped-up challenge that major courses present. “On easier courses,” Henrik Stenson, the winner of the 2016 Open Championship, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.golf.com/news/columns/2019/05/20/brooks-koepka-no-nonsense-superstar-golf-needs&quot;&gt;told &lt;i&gt;Golf&lt;/i&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;, “where there is not such a penalty for bad drives and many players have wedges into greens, it is much harder for [Mr Koepka] to separate himself. A really tough setup brings out Brooks’s advantages. He’s so straight off the tee he is going to hit many more fairways than the average player. And he’s so long he’ll have less club into the green so he’ll hit it closer. If he misses the fairway he still has less club and he’s so strong he can muscle the shot onto the green when others can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ayes have it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evidence suggests that Mr Stenson is on to something. To test whether golfers who have performed far better or worse in majors than in other events can be expected to sustain such a discrepancy, I started with a “naïve” version of our EAGLE prediction model. This system forecasts players’ future scores based on their past ones, without taking account of whether those previous results occurred in majors or elsewhere. For every round by every player in every tournament since 2008, I then compared the player’s round score with what EAGLE would have predicted before they teed off, and recorded the difference between the expected and actual outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, for each round by each player, I took the average of these differences for all previous rounds they had played, broken out into major and non-major categories. For example, before the PGA Championship began, Mr Koepka had beaten EAGLE’s forecasts in majors by exactly 100 strokes over 80 previous rounds, an average of 1.25 strokes per major round. He had also exceeded EAGLE’s predictions outside of majors by 95 strokes, nearly as large a margin. However, it took him 506 non-major rounds to amass that 95-stroke gap, resulting in a far lower average of 0.19 strokes per non-major round. The gap between these two averages, of 1.06 strokes per round, represents how much Mr Koepka has elevated his game when under the sport’s brightest spotlight, compared with his work when the stakes are lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I measured whether this differential could be used to improve EAGLE’s predictions in major tournaments. The result was a resounding “yes”. After about 70 rounds’ worth of major play, golfers “carried forward” about a quarter of their historical over- or under-performance in majors to their next major round. With 200 rounds (roughly 15 years) of data, the ratio was 50-50. To make sure this apparent pattern was not driven entirely by Mr Koepka’s extreme split, I excluded him from the dataset and re-ran the analysis. Although the effect was slightly smaller, it remained significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to all of the other elements in golf forecasting, this is a fairly modest finding. In the case of Mr Koepka, who is the biggest outlier by far, it means that we should expect #MajorKoepka (as we fondly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://twitter.com/DanRosenheck/status/1129078560499617792&quot;&gt;dubbed him on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) to perform about a third of a stroke per round better than the mere-mortal version of Mr Koepka who shows up in non-major events. A shift of one-third of a stroke per round is closer to the difference between a major and, say, a mid-ranking captain than it is to the gap between a major and a lowly private. Nonetheless, it is enough to catapult Mr Koepka from sixth in EAGLE’s rankings to second (though not enough to overtake Mr Johnson, who also benefits somewhat from the adjustment). In contrast, Paul Casey, whom we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/05/15/after-years-as-an-underdog-tiger-woods-is-a-favourite-once-again&quot;&gt;highlighted before the PGA Championship as under-valued by betting markets&lt;/a&gt;, loses 0.15 strokes per round from this correction, dropping him from 12th in EAGLE’s rankings to 18th. For the bulk of his career, Mr Woods has played at the same high level regardless of the stakes, and is thus unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Mr Woods’s victory at the Masters, we stubbornly insisted that our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/06/our-masters-forecast-is-lukewarm-on-tiger-woods&quot;&gt;bearishness on him&lt;/a&gt; before the tournament was justified, and that we would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/04/16/tiger-woods-made-our-golf-model-look-silly-have-we-learned-a-lesson&quot;&gt;continue to wager against him going forward&lt;/a&gt; at the prevailing betting-market odds. His poor showing when playing alongside Mr Koepka at the PGA Championship offered a small drop of vindication. This time, however, it appears we were wrong to pooh-pooh Mr Koepka’s penchant for bringing his “A” game when major titles are on the line. Look for him to shoot up our projected leaderboard when he seeks to defend his U.S. Open title at Pebble Beach next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 07:40:32 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[On Change UK’s inadequacies, political agreements and missing Scots]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2019/05/20/on-change-uks-inadequacies-political-agreements-and-missing-scots]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_BRP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-20T16:03:00Z&quot;&gt;May 20th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I WAS much impressed by Heidi Allen’s first speech when she left the Conservative Party to join the Independent Group, now known as the Change UK Party. How could the Conservative high command have ignored such a prodigious talent? But I’m afraid I was very much underwhelmed by her performance at a Beer and Brexit debate on May 14th, organised by King’s College, London. Ms Allen is now the acting leader of Change UK. But even as her job title has grown she seems to have shrunk as a politician. Gently interrogated by Anand Menon, the reigning Brexit guru at King’s, she produced a succession of bland and vague answers that suggested that she’s not capable of either rigorous thought or vigorous organisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Allen regurgitated a splattering of good-government platitudes about how Britain needs to be much better at harnessing expertise. Politics should be run more like a business. Parties should take an inventory of the skills and talents of each new intake of MPs. Parliament is run like an old-fashioned gentleman’s club, and so on and so forth. There’s some sense in this—particularly about the skills inventory. But isn’t calling for politics to be run more like a business a bit old hat for a party that presents itself as a change-agent? Donald Trump ran on the promise of using his skills as a businessman to shake up Washington, DC in 2016, and Silvio Berlusconi said the same about Rome in the 1990s. And isn’t the boss of Change UK rather badly placed to call for a more business-like approach to politics? The party has lurched from one disaster to another: failing to establish a brand; faffing about over its name; publicly disagreeing over policies; producing ridiculously slip-shod campaign literature; and, in every way conceivable, allowing itself to be out-performed, out-organised, and out-thought by what is supposed to be the party of out-of-touch bigots, Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change UK looks as if it will get the Palme d’Or for the most risible projects in recent political history. For a moment it looked as if Tom Watson and the Labour Party’s Social Democratic wing might stage a mass walk-out and join the Tiggers (as Change UK members were known when their nascent party was still the Independent Group). But Mr Watson chose to stay and fight and the Tiggers had to rely on the force of their personalities rather than on numbers. The trouble is that this is far from enough: the founders of the Social Democratic Party back in 1983 were big beasts who were capable of making the weather. Change UK is a collection of small beasts who will probably be swept away by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TO EDINBURGH—that wonderful study in stone as poetry—to debate the future of capitalism with Stewart Wood, a Labour peer, courtesy of Reform Scotland, a think-tank. To be honest we struggled to find big things to disagree about. There is broad agreement across the political spectrum about the toughest problems facing Britain: the over-centralisation of economic and political power in London; the long-tail of low-skilled workers who are trapped in low-paying jobs; the cult of short-termism; financial engineering; the lack of respect for the manufacturing sector. And yet the British political class is instead focusing on policies that are as divisive as possible: on the right, leaving the European Union, and on the left, massive state intervention in the “commanding heights” of the economy such as re-nationalising the utilities and taking 10% of the country’s biggest public companies. While we squabble over what is contentious, we fail to address what we agree about.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCOTLAND AND England are arguably further apart politically than they have been at any time in the history of the Union, and not just because the Scots voted to remain in the EU and the English to leave. The Labour Party once specialised in projecting Scottish politicians to the heights of power in Westminster—Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, John Smith, Ramsay MacDonald, Keir Hardie. The Liberal Party and its various off-shoots had deep roots in Scotland as well as the English provinces (think of Jo Grimond and Charles Kennedy). The aristocratic wing of the Tory Party also boasted deep Scottish connections: Alec Douglas-Home had an estate up there and even David Cameron could boast a Scottish name and Scottish shooting buddies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British politics is now as English as it has ever been. The only Scotsman in front line politics is Michael Gove, the adopted son of a Scottish fishmonger, and a man capable of reverting from Oxbridge English to Aberdeen Scottish if need be. The people occupying the great offices of state (the prime minister, the chancellor, the foreign secretary) all seem to be in a competition to see who can be the most southern. The Scottish Labour Party has all but died from complacency and mediocrity and the national party has been captured by a clique of London MPs: Jeremy Corbyn and Emily Thornberry both have seats next door to each other in Islington and Dianne Abbott and John McDonnell both represent London seats. The Scottish Raj that once ruled over its southern neighbour is scattered to the winds: Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have returned to Scotland and Tony Blair is in a private jet somewhere in the mid-Atlantic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political life in Scotland is dominated by a Scottish National Party (SNP) that has no real relevance down south (though it has 35 MPs, and Ian Blackford, their leader, manfully makes the same speech at Prime Minister’s Questions every week about how Britain is taking Scotland out of the EU against its will). The liveliest issue up north at the moment is the upcoming trial of Alex Salmond on charges including sexual assault and attempted rape. (He says he is innocent of any criminality.) This is dividing the SNP—and Scottish politics in general—between admirers of Nicola Sturgeon, who began her political life as Mr Salmond’s protégé but has since turned against him, and Salmond loyalists who think he is being unjustly accused. The squabble could weaken the SNP’s (increasingly death-like) grip on Scottish politics and prepare the way for significant advances for either the Tories or the Labour Party, with profound implications for the next general election down south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other great issue is Ruth Davidson’s re-emergence on the scene after several months on maternity leave. If things had gone well with Brexit, Ms Davidson would be re-appearing just as the Tory Party was putting Brexit behind it and turning to the question of where Britain needs to go now it is leaving the EU (Ms Davidson is a remainer who has reconciled herself to delivering the will of the people). But the Brexit problem is even more fraught today than it was when she went on leave—and the Tory brand is far more toxic. Ms Davidson resisted enormous pressure from within her party to loosen its connection with the Conservative Party south of the border. With Brexit lurching from disaster to disaster and the Tory Party increasingly associated with the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, she may rue her decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 04:40:14 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Does carving up conglomerates create shareholder value?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/20/does-carving-up-conglomerates-create-shareholder-value]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_woc029.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-20T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 20th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate fashions come and go, and this season’s is industrial break-ups. In America and Europe, once-sprawling conglomerates are being carved up into focused companies that investors hope will fare better on their own. Those banking on quick returns have mostly been disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conglomerates thrived in the 1970s, and made a comeback after the merger frenzy of the late 1990s. They are beloved of megalomaniac bosses keen to prove they can run empires peddling anything from train carriages to &lt;small&gt;CT&lt;/small&gt; scanners (as Siemens currently does, albeit not, as it announced last week, for much longer). But the argument that diversity lets a firm’s healthy arms prop up temporarily frail ones is, once again, losing ground in the rich world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private-equity funds have pots of money to buy unwanted divisions. Listing companies—or spinning them off to existing investors—is easier than it once was. Plenty of activist hedge funds are pressing firms to restructure, hoping to cash in when the sum of conglomerates’ parts fetches more than the whole (studies show this can be true in the long run).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gauging the impact of a break-up announcement is hard. Investors price in its likelihood before a company owns up to “exploring strategic options”. Splits often follow bad results that enfeeble the management, which may in turn mean worse news down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our chart, which takes the first detailed news reports of a spin-off as its starting-point, shows that of recent break-ups, only Honeywell, which filed listing documents for its car-parts and home-security arms last August, has subsequently outperformed the broader market. United Technologies has kept pace with it. General Electric, Thyssenkrupp, DowDuPont and &lt;small&gt;ABB&lt;/small&gt; have not. If their share prices fall any more, they will be ripe for a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 04:40:13 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Holding out on Huawei]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/20/holding-out-on-huawei]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_wbp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-20T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 20th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ON MAY 20TH it became clear that some of the world’s most prominent technology companies—Google, Intel and Qualcomm—had stopped selling software, hardware and licences for intellectual property to Huawei, a Chinese manufacturer of phones and networking gear. This followed an announcement by the American government on May 15th that it was banning the export of American technology to Huawei unless companies got a special licence from the Department of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei, which sources a sixth of all its components from American companies, appears vulnerable. It has stockpiled enough components to keep its business running for several months. But reconfiguring its supply chain so that it is no longer reliant on American firms, which would be the only way to truly insulate itself from the trade wars, will be hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has stopped supplying Huawei with the proprietary components of Android, the search firm’s mobile operating system. That loss will have no effect on Huawei’s biggest market, mainland China, where it only uses the free, open-source components of Android. But outside China, where the firm bundles Google’s own services like Gmail and search with the tens of millions of phones it sells every year, the loss of Google’s software is crippling (and is a boon for Samsung, the South Korean market leader). Huawei is working on its own alternative, codenamed HongMeng OS according to state media, but is unlikely to be able to deploy it without significant disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s hardware is threatened, too. Intel, Qualcomm and a host of other companies have stopped supplying the parts and designs that Huawei needs to build its phones and network gear. Huawei’s sales grew by 20% in 2018 to $107bn. If the supply tap is not turned back on, 2019 will be rather less rosy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farther removed from American jurisdiction, Huawei’s Asian suppliers have been more circumspect. TSMC, the Taiwanese company which makes the semiconductors on which Huawei’s entire business (and that of most other technology companies) depends, is still supplying the firm, but says that it is examining its export-control systems to make sure that it is in compliance with American law. Other Taiwanese companies are following its lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s Asian suppliers must obey American law on export control, in theory at least, because it prohibits not just the direct sale of American technology by American firms, but also its transmission through non-American companies like TSMC. In reality, America has few levers to force companies like TSMC to comply with its laws. Losing TSMC as a supplier would be the final blow for Huawei. Currently, that is unlikely, but if conflict escalates TSMC could become the next battleground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei says it has been preparing for an American assault on its supply chains for years. In April, Peter Zhou, a company executive, suggested that the firm had anticipated the rising tension between China and America and prepared accordingly. The firm says it has been remaking its supply chains and so will not crack under pressure as its domestic competitor, ZTE, did last year when faced with a similar ban (one ultimately lifted by President Donald Trump in response to a personal plea from the Chinese president, Xi Jinping).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the actual state of Huawei’s preparations may be better gauged by comments made by Ren Zhengfei, the boss, on May 18th. He claimed that the company would be “fine” without its American suppliers, yet conceded that he expected revenues to grow 20% more slowly as a result of the ban. If America retains the ban as Huawei’s stockpiles dwindled, the company—and indeed China’s internet ecosystem—would be more seriously damaged. More probably, America will use its ability to withhold components from Huawei as a bargaining chip in a future trade deal with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further such action could also harm America and its allies. Beijing would probably retaliate, perhaps disrupting the supply chains of American companies within China. And although American export law is a powerful weapon in this trade war, its impact will diminish with time. Every time America lashes out at a Chinese company it hastens Chinese efforts to find suppliers elsewhere. Huawei’s semiconductor division, HiSilicon, has been designing its own versions of the chips it buys from American companies. The firm’s HongMeng OS is waiting in the wings. Next time America wants to attack the supply chain, it may find that there are fewer convenient targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 04:40:12 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
