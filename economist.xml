It was published in the June/July 2019 issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a dark Saturday afternoon in February James Ellroy, America’s pre-eminent crime novelist and chronicler of depravity and excess, was having problems with his central heating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s cold in here, isn’t it?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agreed that it was. Ellroy, who is tall and bald, and looks like a cross between Michel Foucault and Uncle Fester from the Addams Family, got up and spent a few moments peering and poking at the thermostat. Then he announced that he would phone his girlfriend—and former wife—Helen Knode, a writer who has her own flat in the same apartment block near Union Station in Denver, Colorado. Knode was at home making turkey chilli. “She should come over and take a look,” he said. “This is not my metier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At bookshop readings and on TV chat-shows, Ellroy presents himself as “the Demon Dog of American fiction”, a confident huckster full of scurrilous gossip and risqué jokes. He has described this shtick as constituting about 7% of who he really is. “I like to fuck with people,” he said, by way of explanation. “Why mince words?” But as he wandered around his flat, trying to determine whether some barely audible sound was a train outside his window or a pipe stirring sluggishly to life, he seemed ungainly and boyish—even sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His possessions are minimal: a few pieces of stark, mid-century furniture, a wall of cellophane-covered hard­backs, some classical CDs, a hi-fi, a boom box and an exercise machine. His fridge is empty apart from shrink-wrapped sausages. For ten years, Ellroy and Knode owned a red-furred bull terrier named Margaret, after his favourite British prime minister. (“She never liked me—she’d just follow me around and bark at me and oppress me furiously as if I was a Labour Party whip.”) These days Ellroy makes do with pictures of dogs and “my Gila monster”, a life-sized artist’s model of a lizard with whom he conducts imaginary conversations. There is no television or computer, no bills, papers or bric-a-brac. The only interruption to this order was the arrival of advance copies of his new novel, “This Storm”, out this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a lifestyle that is peaceful, housebound and nearly Amish in its lack of material indulgence. When I suggested that he seems quite frugal for a bestselling novelist several of whose books have been turned into movies, he replied that he likes to buy cars (he currently owns one car). On an average day, he will eat a bowl of plain oatmeal and drink several cups of black filter coffee, engage in various acts of “prayer and ponder” (he is a non-churchgoing Lutheran), check in with his assistant by fax or on the landline, and take naps. Apart from writing the occasional movie treatment or magazine piece, Ellroy’s only commitment is the monkish, monomaniacal pursuit of what he identifies as “God’s calling for me as a novelist”. “I feel like I’m the great American crime writer,” he told me one afternoon. He weighed the statement for a couple of seconds, as if scrolling through his rivals: Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and so on. Then he said, “You can make that case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy’s breakthrough came in 1987 with “The Black Dahlia”, his seventh novel, which was based on a real-life murder. The novel was the first volume in his LA Quartet, a series of complex detective stories that doubled as a portrait of the city after the second world war. (In 1997, the third book, “L.A. Confidential”, was made into a film starring Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, and won two Oscars.) In Ellroy’s hands, the crime novel became a compound of historical saga, star-crossed romance, pastiche journalism and psychological case-study. His prose heaved with period slang and the books featured a mix of real and invented characters through which Ellroy explored the roots of criminal and even psychopathic behaviour. Dennis Lehane, an American novelist, told me that the LA Quartet is “the towering achievement of American crime fiction. It’s the monolith, the one that came in and casts its shadow over everything else”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the series, Ellroy wanted his next project to be a dense social portrait steeped in vice and crime but without being “beholden to a murder investigation”. The result, in 1995, was “American Tabloid”, perhaps his greatest novel and the beginning of a new sequence. The Underworld USA trilogy recounts major episodes in American history between 1958 and 1972—the Bay of Pigs, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and the Kennedys, the Vietnam war—from the perspective of various invented hit men and hangers-on. Ellroy, who has described his work as an exercise in “moral art”, told me that he found the idea of “killing for money or for dubious ideology particularly horrible and conscienceless. To humanise these characters and to live inside their heads and to connect them to the rise of someone with the inflated reputation of a John F. Kennedy was just too good to pass up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy dislikes talk of prophecy or pertinence, but there are clear parallels between the worlds he created in the LA Quartet and the Underworld USA trilogy and today’s political scene. These volumes, which are being republished by Everyman’s Library this summer, offer a multi-dimensional portrait of American extremity: greasy-palmed complicity between politics and big business, rogue operatives and unchecked institutions, race hatred, police brutality, far-reaching federal investigations, corrupt land deals, lascivious and lying presidents, actress-molesting moguls and populist uprisings. As Knode said one evening at dinner, “It’s Ellroy’s world, we just live in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born Lee Earle Ellroy in Los Angeles in 1948. His mother was a heavy-drinking, free-living nurse from German farming stock in Wisconsin. His father, 17 years her senior, was an accountant, highly competent but idle, who worked briefly as Rita Hayworth’s business manager. When Ellroy was six, his parents divorced. Ellroy lived with his mother but felt ashamed of her behaviour. He has frequently recalled his childhood view of her as “a drunk and a whore”. In June 1958 she was found, raped and strangled, in an ivy patch next to a school playing field in El Monte, California. The case was never solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy and his father didn’t talk about Geneva Hilliker Ellroy. “It was as if, after the coroner’s inquest, the shroud was dropped,” he said. Ellroy took refuge in crime fiction. His father, who was “never cheap”, would buy him at least a book a week, at Chevalier’s Books on Larchmont Boulevard. He estimates that during the summer after his mother died, he read at least 25 Hardy Boys novels. The experience was “a mediated dialogue on my mother’s death. Here I am—decidedly large and strange and prone to volatile curiosities, living with my old man, who talks to the TV and works infrequently and everyone thinks he’s my grandfather, and the un-house-broken dog urinating and defecating with abandon all over the place. And here is Everytown USA. Order is restored. The killer is identified and justice is enacted. And these nice-looking kids have nifty-looking girlfriends and a sidekick and cars and speedboats, and their widowed father is a policeman and has slick threads, and he’ll remarry sooner or later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_BLP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190601_BLP504.jpg 200w,

It contained a chapter on the rape and vivisection of a 22-year-old would-be starlet Elizabeth Short, the so-called Black Dahlia, a crime that Ellroy has described as “pure misogynist insanity”. That chapter “went through me like a jolt”, said Ellroy: “It was more shocking to me than my mother’s death.” He says his encounter with the case was “the formative experience of my life”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ellroy wasn’t reading, he was acting out. “I’d do anything to get attention,” he said. In 1962 he was enrolled at Fairfax High School, a rare “white-trasher” in a swanky environment. He liked to rile his Jewish classmates and even attended American Nazi party meetings. (“You could not have imagined a more pathetic bunch of fools.”) In a mock election, he was the only kid who—partly for anti-Catholic reasons—voted for Nixon over Kennedy. Sometimes he broke into the homes of his richer neighbours to smell their underwear. But behind the bad behaviour, he felt neglected, frightened, hungry and lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things came to a head in late adolescence: “1965 was pretty heady for me,” he said. “I got kicked out of high school. I joined the army. I flew to basic training, in Fort Polk, Louisiana. I had a big crack-up. I was sent home. My dad was dying. I went back to Fort Polk. Then I returned to LA, because his death was imminent.” His father’s last discernible words to Ellroy were, “Try to pick up every waitress who serves you,” which he calls “a legacy I have fulfilled, with mixed results, dare I say”. After being expelled from the army, Ellroy moved to LA and spent his time boozing, shoplifting, “peeping around” and reading potboilers. At times he lived in Robert Burns Park. To survive, he’d sell his blood plasma. For kicks he’d drink scotch, inhale Benzedrex, smoke weed and annoy hippies (“I’d say ‘Bomb Vietnam’, things like that”). On the night Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, a woman caught him on a rooftop masturbating while high on uppers. He was once beaten up by a drag queen called Peaches. One morning, he woke up in San Francisco and wondered how he’d got there. He was arrested some 40 times, for driving under the influence, public drunkenness, shoplifting, trespassing and burglary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970s Ellroy realised that substance abuse was impeding his other appetites. “I wanted to laugh, I wanted to read, I wanted girls, I wanted to sate my curiosities, I wanted to go to the movies. I loved art. I loved great music. I loved history. I loved looking at pictures in magazines.” He also had an idea for a novel. In 1977 Ellroy joined Alcoholics Anonymous and got clean: he liked the extremity of total abstinence. He found a job as a caddy at the Bel Air Country Club and, aged 30, began to write. His idea became “Brown’s Requiem”, published in 1981 as a little-noticed paperback. Around this time Ellroy walked into the Mysterious Bookshop in New York and told the proprietor, Otto Penzler, “I’m the next big one.” Penzler replied, “Would you forgive me if I reserve judgment?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy wrote a series of straight genre novels before he fulfilled his own prophecy with “The Black Dahlia”. Another writer had already published a novel about the murder of Elizabeth Short, which had been turned into a film, but Ellroy realised that his own peculiar brew of experiences and sensibilities had furnished him with a unique perspective. “I’ve lived in that kind of male excess of booze, dope, girls, high-flying bullshit,” he says, but he is also a veteran of AA, a Christian, conservative, moralist and child of divorce whose mother was murdered. He is both far closer than most novelists to sinful conduct, and more willing to speak the language of moral and religious judgment. Unafraid to join the dots between his own life and his creative output, Ellroy says that his personal suffering “dogged me and informed the texts. Police officers charged with solving a series of baffling crimes, or government provocateurs and buffoons, or the authoritarian figure who needs to impose himself upon external events in order to plumb the secrets of his own identity—I’ve been able to exposit the lonely beating heart of those guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evening in February Ellroy embarked on a rare outdoor excursion—dinner with his friend Jerry Ackerman, a FBI agent and a novelist. Ackerman is a compact, balding man in his late 40s who shares Ellroy’s taste for law and order, mid-century Los Angeles, traditional manners, porkpie hats and beef. Ocean Prime, a restaurant near Ellroy’s apartment, has numerous steak options and elaborately courteous waiters. As we headed out Knode whispered to me: “When people talk about the Denver food scene, this isn’t what they mean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversation touched on Ellroy’s current reading, the thrillers of Daniel Silva, which concern an art restorer who is an agent for Mossad, Israel’s secret service. (“It’s a preposterous combination of trades,” Ellroy said.) Noting how many historical events surface—the arrest of Adolf Eichmann, the Black September conflict—he said, “It’s like a Middle Eastern Ellroy-lite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is that a blurb?” Ackerman asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I think Daniel Silva, who outsells me about 40 to one, would really appreciate that. ‘I’m better than him’—Ellroy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackerman had brought along material for Ellroy’s next novel—a book about the US Treasury. His books often begin with a moment of inspiration. He says that the idea for “The Big Nowhere” (1988) – a conspiracy novel from the LA Quartet that touches on homosexuality, communism, the LA Dodgers, anti-Mexican violence and the legacy of the Holocaust—came to him in a second and a half on a lonely Saturday night in the winter of 1986. Its even more intricate successor, “L.A. Confidential”, also occurred to him “in a single rush”. Then comes the graft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With help from an assistant, Ellroy researches and then writes a detailed synopsis that’s often as long as the book itself. (Without it, he says he wouldn’t be able to “write a book worth a shit”.) Then he flies to New York to discuss the outline with his editors at Knopf, his American publisher. Finally, he says, “I execute at great length and revise in great detail.” A working day can begin as early as 1.45am. “I’ve got the outline typed up on the desk. I get up, say my prayers, have a cup of cold coffee I made the night before, get it in my system quicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy called his taste in language “very precise”. Small imperfections “leap out at me”. He avoids semi-colons and shifts indiscriminately to the present tense—“which drives copy editors crazy”. “If you want to be very good at this,” he said, “the road is consciousness. Am I repeating this motif? Is this plausible? Does this track logically? Are the paragraph breaks in the right place? Is this information exposited too early? When should this man meet this woman? That was the gradual electrifying revelation – if one has native talent of the level I possess, then it’s about consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy says of Knode that “There’s no one else for me but her.” They met in 1990 and they married a year later: “The aggregate of all the other women I’ve known don’t equal Helen in soul, gravity or native intellect.” The two share a tendency towards solitude and a strict morality. But whereas Ellroy failed to finish high school, Knode has a master’s from Cornell and worked for a magazine, LA Weekly, which sprang from the counterculture Ellroy detested. He is loping and saturnine, husky and housebound, with a tendency to bark, bay and growl; Knode is prone to gales of laughter and micro-bursts of surprise. She exudes an air of sensible busyness as she zips about the city in one of her many well-cut trench-coats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ellroy and Knode met he had recently entered a period of conscious self-restraint, even self-punishment. Editing “L.A. Confidential” he had turned against flourish, metaphor and scene-setting, developing a habit of “cutting words and cutting words” that resulted in a kind of staccato shorthand. He was also growing more isolated. His behaviour was characterised, Knode told me, by “churning, compulsion, unreachability, one crazy idea after another. This was a guy who never had a moment of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, as he was working on “American Tabloid”, Knode took action. She felt that he needed to confront the fact of his mother’s murder more directly. That Christmas she gave Ellroy a framed copy of a newspaper photograph that depicted him in the moments after he was told his mother had been killed. Soon afterwards a journalist in California, who had access to his mother’s police file, contacted him. Ellroy’s response—not the one Knode intended – was to attempt to solve the case, more than three decades on, and write up his findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My Dark Places”, a memoir that explored the immediate aftermath and longer legacy of his mother’s death, was published in 1996. Ellroy recognises that the book was, at best, a partial reckoning with his personal trauma. At home things carried on much as before. Ellroy has described his conduct as boorish, oblivious, callow, heedless, isolated, “preposterously male”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001 Ellroy suffered episodes of sleeplessness and hypochondria and, eventually, a nervous breakdown. He became addicted to sedatives and sleeping pills. When I asked Ellroy what might have averted the breakdown, he said, “A different mind, a different soul. It was everything I’d suppressed in my life.” He also blames “The Cold Six Thousand”, the bestselling middle chapter of the USA trilogy, which represents the furthest extreme of his impulse to cut. Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, says this book is his favourite Ellroy novel but also “the logical acme point. He doesn’t give us a break, ever. There’s an element of obsession-compulsion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_BLP505.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190601_BLP505.jpg 200w,

Wayne rotates. Pete moves stateside. Laurent’s there. Ditto Flash. They funnel stateside. Stanton stays in-country. Ditto Mesplède. Tiger Kamp runs low-supervised. The war escalates. More troops pass through. The kadre hits Saigon half-assed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Knode, the novel reflected Ellroy’s frazzled state. She recalled thinking, “We don’t need any literary criticism here—we just need a doctor!” As things turned out, there were numerous doctors—and an actor. When Ellroy was in psychiatric lockdown, a friend put Knode in touch with Carrie Fisher. “She was a big help,” Knode says. “She knew everything. In the middle of James’s crack-up, she gave me a better picture of the modern medical landscapes and the gaps in its treatment than I’d had in two years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy said that Fisher died with drugs in her system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She never claimed to be clean, Big Dog,” Knode said. “She just claimed to know everything about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy kicked the drugs but continued to show signs of collapse. In “The Hilliker Curse” (2010), his second, more candid attempt to grapple with his mother’s legacy, he quotes a letter from Knode recalling that during this time he would drive his car too fast, dribble, wear shit-stained trousers, and audibly masturbate while her family was visiting. She got tired of waiting for him to change. Knode introduced the idea of an open marriage, but in the end it was Ellroy who met someone else—a left-wing academic named Joan. Ellroy and Knode divorced in April 2006. But they continued to talk on the phone almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy’s relationship with Joan was short­lived. After they separated, he moved to Los Angeles—the first time he had lived there in 25 years. “So, I’m alone—I’m gassing, I’m yearning.” He was looking southbound out of his window on Rossmore Avenue when he had another “synaptic flash: forlorn-looking Japanese, in wintertime, in a bus, going up a mountain road in a snowstorm to the Manzanar internment camp in the High Sierras. Immediately I knew: four novels, World War Two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Knode reunited in 2015 when he was promoting “Perfidia”, the first of his new LA Quartet. Knode was living in Denver, so Ellroy bought a flat down the hall. Knode lives more conventionally than him. Her apartment has a kitchen table, wallpaper and a comfortable-looking sofa. The art on the walls doesn’t all involve dogs or crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evening Ellroy and I had dinner at Knode’s place. It was Saturday night—fight night. Ellroy was excited about the boxing but also still distracted by the problems with “the fucking heat”. As we entered he turned to me. “Helen wants you to take off your shoes. I don’t go for that shit myself.” On a table in the hall was a copy of “This Storm” and a post-it note saying “Read me now”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knode and Ellroy watch boxing on two channels, Showtime and the Zone, which is run by Eddie Hearn, a boxing promoter. Knode said that Hearn had revolutionised their lives, but when the Zone stuttered on her Apple TV he was held responsible for ruining their evening. The refrain “Fuck Eddie Hearn” soon established itself. When he wasn’t yelling at the TV, Ellroy refused Knode’s offer of tea with the formula, “Fuck that shit.” He requested a cup of black coffee, and Knode frowned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I gots to have it, baby,” he said. “Just one cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not underwriting this,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know—it is late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knode told me that though Ellroy’s propensity to repeat certain jokes and riffs is unchanged, in other ways he’s grown up. He is able to “listen now in a way he wasn’t able to before. He’s burned out a lot of the bad shit.” She mentioned the dinners with Jerry Ackerman—regular meet-ups with a friend. He has a healthier relationship with the murder of Elizabeth Short. And after many years of living exclusively with his own books, he has started to read again. His current lifestyle, though oatmeal-heavy and pet-free, constitutes a loosening of the reins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he has been adding words. Like Ellroy’s earlier books, “This Storm” has short paragraphs, single-clause sentences and heightened, at times wearying repetition. Ellroy acknowledges that he still makes “purportedly clean and direct” writers such as Dashiell Hammett and Ernest Hemingway seem “absolutely florid”. But with help from Knode and his editors he is also now convinced that, if he wants the books to have “emotional resonance”, he needs to open things up, if only a little. He calls this “a new style”—“the perfect balance” of the precise and lyrical. It’s as if, over the last decade, he has realised the need to embrace, if not equally, the two sides of his nature—wildness and control, rectitude and romanticism, “emotionality” and a spotless sideboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my last morning in Denver, I visited Ellroy at his flat and Knode dropped by. She asked if we were getting tired of “talking about Ellroy”. He said that we were not. Reflecting on his current circumstances, Ellroy says that he’s feeling “just outrageous good will for people”, before admitting that “I can be short-tempered and I can be rancorous and all these things, if people are pushing up against me or taking liberties”—for example, when waiters use the greeting “Hi, guys.” Then he paused, searching around for words: “I’ve just never been this happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His new work reflects that. Without stinting on traditional Ellroy pleasures, it contains more hope and consolation. Fans of Ellroy’s earlier work may feel that he’s gone soft. Instead of evil or mercenary violence, and the “tableau of madness, hatefulness and historical dysfunction” constructed in “The Cold Six Thousand”, “This Storm” is concerned with “friendship, bravery, the ability of individuals of a wide stripe to supersede their differences and limitations and tell the truth to themselves.” Even the protagonist—“a monstrous psychopath, a fascist, a racial provocateur”—proves himself vulnerable and capable of fraternal love for a Japanese man. “This Storm” offers, says Ellroy, “the thrill of human beings changing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve taken a big breath and relaxed,” Knode told him. “It’s a lot more lucid, less internally tortured. I can just feel the oozing humanity in this one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy looked lovingly in her direction. “I’m honoured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should be,” she said. “You did the work.” Ellroy gave a growl of assent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leo Robson is a freelance journalist who has written for the &lt;/em&gt;New Yorker&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 20:40:19 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A journalist’s arrest is a worrying sign of impunity in Russia]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/06/07/a-journalists-arrest-is-a-worrying-sign-of-impunity-in-russia]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_eup507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-07T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 7th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE HEADLINES on Ivan Golunov’s articles make it clear that he may have made some enemies. One article pledges to explain “how officials, the security services, and bandits carve up the market for funeral services”. Others allege that the family of a vice-mayor “made billions and bought up mansions and apartments”, or promise to list “who’s making a killing on Moscow’s reconstruction”. As an investigative journalist for independent Russian media outlets, Mr Golunov developed a reputation for thorough shoe-leather reporting and scrupulous work with procurement databases to expose state corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of June 6th, Moscow police detained Mr Golunov in the city centre while he was walking to meet a source. The police claimed to have found a stash of drugs in his backpack, and released photos of a small drug lab supposedly discovered in his apartment. Mr Golunov has been booked on charges of selling narcotics, carrying a potential 10- to 20-year sentence. He was prevented from contacting anyone for more than 12 hours. After a sympathetic detective tipped off a friend of Mr Golunov’s, a lawyer arrived at last. Mr Golunov alleged that police had planted the drugs and beat him up. The police refused to let medical personnel document his wounds, though they deny any misbehaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Golunov’s editors at Meduza, an independent news site, believe his journalism is the reason for his arrest. “We know that Ivan has received threats in recent months, and we think we know from whom,” they wrote. Colleagues and friends describe Mr Golunov as a virtual teetotaller who obeyed the law scrupulously, to avoid giving the authorities excuses to harass him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the Russian reality, an investigative journalist even crosses the street with particular care: only on a green light, so there will be nothing to pin on him,” said Svetlana Reiter, a fellow investigative journalist. Meduza says that the handwriting on notes in police photographs does not appear to match Mr Golunov’s. Acquaintances told that site that they recognise only one of the photographs as his apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brazenness of the charges is not a glitch. Instead, it highlights the increasing impunity of the Russian security services. Police are known for planting drugs to meet arrest quotas. Until now such tactics have been used against political opponents only in Chechnya, where Oyub Titiev, a human-rights activist, was sentenced in March to four years in prison on drug charges that observers called fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Mr Titiev’s, Mr Golunov’s arrest is meant to send a message. “It’s a signal that they can do the same or worse with any of us,” said Pavel Kanygin of Novaya Gazeta, an independent newspaper. Journalists and supporters gathered on June 7th near the police headquarters for a series of one-man pickets, a tactic activists use to avoid a ban on protesting in groups without permission. Police detained at least seven of them—one by one—including Mr Kanygin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As police were hauling the protesters into police vans, President Vladimir Putin was striding on stage at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Russia’s yearly gathering of economic bigwigs. The atmosphere at this year’s forum has been marred by the arrest in February of Michael Calvey, a prominent American investor, on dubious fraud charges. Mr Putin touted Russia’s business climate and endorsed the investigation into Mr Calvey. “Just, legal decisions will be made,” Mr Putin insisted. The arrest of Mr Golunov suggests that in today’s Russia, lawlessness often masquerades as justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 04:40:42 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to increase empathy and unite society]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/06/07/how-to-increase-empathy-and-unite-society]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190608_OPP509.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-07T17:39:53Z&quot;&gt;Jun 7th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF THERE is one thing that people on both the left and right can agree, it is that expressions of our political and social differences have become markedly less cordial—and that this makes it harder to find common ground and solve common problems. The good news is that science is on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is not like a person’s adult height, something unalterable. Instead, it is a characteristic that can be actively encouraged or discouraged. This is the central message of a new book, “The War for Kindness: Building Empathy in a Fractured World”, by Jamil Zaki, the director of the Social Neuroscience Lab at Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to structure our workplaces, schools, public spaces—and even media—to increase interactions with people from other walks of life may boost the respect that people bestow on others. This, in turn, may go some way towards helping societies to overcome political polarisation, racism, anti-immigrant anger and cultural divisions. Although Red Staters and Blue Staters, or Brexiteers and Remainers, may not lock arms—any more than the lion will lie down with the lamb—at least they will be able to talk to each other without their faces turning purple with rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future initiative asked Mr Zaki several questions about what empathy is and how to foster it. Following that is an excerpt from his book, on the importance of contact with others to improve relations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190608_opp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190608_opp502.jpg 200w,

Are people less empathetic today than in the past?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamil Zaki:&lt;/strong&gt; Empathy is our ability to share and understand one another’s feelings—a psychological “superglue” that connects people and undergirds co-operation and kindness. Psychologists and neuroscientists measure empathy in numerous ways: including asking people how much they care about others, measuring how much they mimic others’ facial expressions or flinch when someone else is in pain, testing how accurately they decode others’ experiences, and examining overlap in brain activity when people experience pleasure versus seeing others happy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common measure of empathy, a questionnaire, has been completed by hundreds of thousands of people since the late 1970s. About ten years ago, psychologists examined these data over time and found a steep drop in empathy, especially in the 21st century. Strikingly, the average American in 2009 scored as less empathic than 75% of people in 1979. We do not know the causes of this decline, though the rise of online technology and increasing polarisation seem relevant. Whatever the source, this drop in empathy should concern all of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we harness the latest findings in neuropsychology to increase empathy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Zaki:&lt;/strong&gt; The first step is to understand that we can increase our empathy. My least favorite phrase in neuroscience is “hard-wired,” the idea that because something resides in the brain, it is fixed and immutable. People often have that notion about empathy—that each of us has a “level” of care built in to us, which, like our adult height, will never change. But our brains are plastic, and change in response to experiences, habits and practices. The same goes for empathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in a landmark study published two years ago, neuroscientists trained people in “loving kindness” meditation, a contemplative practice focusing on building people’s care for others. After several months of this practice, people reported greater empathy, understood others’ feelings more precisely and acted more generously to strangers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even more strikingly, parts of their brain associated with empathy grew in volume, underscoring not only how we can increase empathy, but that we can. In fact, my colleagues and I have found that even understanding that empathy is under our control empowers people to work harder at it, especially with people who look or think differently than themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on that, populism, anti-immigration and anti-“other” is on the rise—how can we realistically redesign our community interactions, workplaces, schools, media, etc, to apply neuroscience and psychology to defeat this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Zaki:&lt;/strong&gt; One of our most powerful psychological instincts is to divide people into categories; for every “us” there is a “them.” This turns pernicious when mixed with competition, conflict and fear. Under these circumstances, empathy evaporates or even reverses into schadenfreude, or enjoyment of the other side’s suffering. The wreckage of America’s political climate, mixed with social media and online bullying, can seem like a schadenfreude buffet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counteracting these trends means putting people in the position to replace “us and them” with “you and I”, as well as the incentives to see outsiders as people, rather than mere symbols of their group. One reliable way to do this is to bring people from different groups together under egalitarian circumstances and with shared goals. Another way is to encourage people to understand how empathy can be useful to them. For instance, my colleague Robb Willer has found that when people empathise with individuals on the other end of the political spectrum, they can actually argue more persuasively for their own position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; Using your methods, won’t empathy simply develop in those who are prone to be empathetic anyway—leaving the most vile people unaffected and the world unimproved: a snowflake of kindness amid a blizzard of misanthropy? Or am I being too cynical?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Zaki:&lt;/strong&gt; I think cynicism is understandable in this cultural moment. I see it all around me, which is part of why I wrote the book. But despite appearances, even “vile” people have the capacity to become more caring under the right circumstances. In the book I tell the story of Tony McAleer, a neo Nazi whose early life was an embodiment of hatred, anger and fear. If anyone would be lost to empathy, it would be him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet after meeting a Jewish man who refused to hate him back (again, moving from “us and them” to “you and I”), he reformed. Tony and his colleagues now run the group Life After Hate, which extracts others from the dark places they once inhabited. There are ample data points demonstrating that people with low empathy, even psychopaths, can turn on their care when properly motivated to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the most important finding from the science of empathy that people don’t know, that if they did know, the world would be a better place? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Zaki:&lt;/strong&gt; The first insight people should take with them is that we can grow our empathy if we want. Our emotions are not animalistic impulses that are out of our control. We can guide them, empathising with purpose—in ways that accord with our values. A second insight is that empathy is helpful, not just to the people around us, but to ourselves as well. It is easy to think of empathy as a squishy soft-skill in a hard world, which allows us to be nice, but also leaves us open to be trampled or left behind. But in many ways, empathic individuals finish first: experiencing greater happiness, less stress and greater professional success. Poetically, one of the best ways we can help ourselves starts with caring for each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190608_opp503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190608_opp503.jpg 200w,

World War II had transformed the city into a weapons factory, and people poured in from around the country as manufacturing boomed. Housing became scarce. Black workers were excluded from housing projects and often paid triple the rent whites did. When the city earmarked a new project for black tenants only, whites burned crosses outside it. As summer arrived, racial tension boiled over. On June 20, blacks heard that a white mob had thrown a woman and her child off the Belle Isle Bridge; whites heard that blacks had raped and killed a woman on the same bridge. Neither event had actually occurred, but the imaginary mobs spawned real ones. They clashed, and in the next thirty-six hours, thirty-four people died, hundreds were injured, and thousands were arrested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a national disgrace and a low point for American race relations. But there was a glimmer of hope: whites and blacks who had worked or studied with members of the other race were far less likely to join in the riots, and more likely to engage in peaceful behaviors, such as sheltering other-race individuals from violence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychologist Gordon Allport noticed this, and saw a trend: The better people knew outsiders, the less they hated them. This was true elsewhere as well. Seventy-five percent of residents in all-white housing projects said they would dislike living alongside blacks, but only 25 percent of white residents in mixed projects actually disliked having black neighbors. Sixty-two percent of soldiers in all-white platoons opposed integrating the armed forces; among whites who had been in a mixed platoon, that number was 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his magnum opus, The Nature of Prejudice, Allport reasoned that bigotry often boils down to a lack of acquaintance. Its antidote was just as simple: Bring people together, and they’ll awaken to their common humanity. A similar thought led Mark Twain to quip, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.” In psychology, this idea came to be known as “contact theory,” and it caught fire. Allport’s book, published in 1954, became a bestseller; he delighted in spotting it at airports and malls alongside beach novels. Thanks to him, optimists everywhere came to believe that hatred was a misunderstanding and that contact could fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allport stressed that contact would not always work. In some cases it could make things worse—for instance, whites who merely saw more blacks, but didn’t get to know them, might perceive them as a threat. Time has proven Allport right. The visibility of immigrants in the United Kingdom fueled a nationalist wave that crested with Brexit. In Canada, Tony used the presence of immigrants to whip up white aggression. Even moderate people can be driven toward prejudice by the wrong type of contact. In a recent study, the political scientist Ryan Enos planted Latino passengers on a Boston commuter train at the same time each morning for ten days. White commuters who had been on a train with Latinos grew less tolerant of immigration than they had been before, or than passengers who took the very next train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when contact doesn’t hurt, it might not help. “Goodwill contact without concrete goals accomplishes nothing,” Allport wrote. He laid out a recipe for how to make it useful: Bring groups together and give them equal status, even if one group has more power the rest of the time. Focus on their mutual goals. Make it personal; let people learn about each other’s idiosyncrasies. And support cooperation between groups through the institutions around them. Fulfill these tenets, Allport claimed, and contact could do wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory might sound naïve—less rigorous science than Haight-Ashbury handholding. But it’s one of the most well-studied concepts in psychology. In a recent analysis of more than a quarter of a million people, the pattern was clear: The more time someone spends with outsiders, the less prejudice they express. Contact warms sentiments toward many types of outsiders. Imagine two straight, young, able white people born in the United States. Evidence suggests that the one who gets to know a diverse group will exhibit less bias toward black and Hispanic people, immigrants from Asia, Mexico, and Central America, elderly and disabled people, and the LGBTQ community than their more sheltered counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact can work even when people don’t seek it out. White college freshmen randomly assigned to black roommates are less prejudiced by spring than students with same-race roommates. It doesn’t take a school year to help people warm up to new groups, either. In one recent study, trans- and cisgender canvassers went door-to-door in Florida to discuss transgender rights. After meaningful conversations with trans canvassers, residents’ transphobia dropped substantially, and they remained more tolerant three months later &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The punchline is simple: Hatred of outsiders is ancient but not inevitable. When people work, live, or play alongside each other, divisions between them melt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why, remember that empathy is a choice, and conflict gives people great reasons to avoid it. When groups compete for scarce resources, they must circle the wagons and scrap for their side. [...] Tribalism becomes natural and—from evolution’s perspective—wise. A linebacker who feels the pain of a running back would have a hard time doing his job; a soldier would find hers impossible. As a result, people in conflict don’t merely misplace their care; they actively throw it away. In one series of studies, conservative Israelis reported that they would prefer not to empathize with Palestinians. This preference, in turn, predicted their actual lack of empathy, for instance when they read about a Palestinian child with cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if callousness is a smart choice during war, it’s a terrible way to achieve peace. Contact remedies this by giving people reasons to care about outsiders. We crave connection and will work to keep social bonds strong. When an outsider joins the ranks of our friends or colleagues, empathizing with them aligns with that goal. The benefits compound: Empathy for one outsider can lead to caring for their entire group. Contact also makes avoiding empathy harder. The sorrow and hope of a neighbor, friend, or colleague are often impossible to block out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact can build empathy even in the toughest settings. After sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, Catholics and Protestants dehumanized each other, but they did so less if they had friends on the other side of the conflict. White Americans who work or live with blacks or Muslims express higher empathy when members of these groups are pro led by law enforcement. Empathy, in turn, promotes solidarity. After the conflict in Ireland, people who felt empathy toward outsiders were more willing to forgive them; in the United States, white Americans who empathized with minority individuals mistreated by police were more likely to join Black Lives Matter protests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;______________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the book “The War for Kindness: Building Empathy in a Fractured World” by Jamil Zaki.

Ms Warren was concerned about the repercussions for middle-class Americans, especially women, who would have a harder time filing for bankruptcy as a result of the bill. A particular target of her ire was Joe Biden, then a senator from Delaware and one of the bill’s strongest backers. “Senators like Joe Biden should not be allowed to sell out women in the morning and be heralded as their friend in the evening,” she wrote at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this day the two are seen as ideological foes. Ms Warren appeals to a fire-breathing leftish section of the party, while Mr Biden has made a concerted effort to court moderate Democratic voters. Yet both contenders for the Democratic nomination released ambitious, detailed environmental plans within hours of one another on June 4th. The striking similarity of their plans shows how the politics of climate change has evolved from a niche issue among Democrats to one of great urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American environmental activists who called for a Green New Deal, particularly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman congresswoman from New York, can claim some credit for this change. A series of recent calamitous weather events—fires, polar vortices, hurricanes and floods—have also helped. This week, 17% of Democrats surveyed by YouGov on behalf of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; said the environment was the most important issue for them. That is second only to health care, the chief issue of last year’s mid-term elections, which captures the attention of 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Green New Deal has two problems. The first is that it is only skeletally sketched, with handwaving in lieu of details for the massive economic reorganisation it envisages. The second is that it includes a gratuitous list of progressive measures—including a federal jobs guarantee, a universal basic income, and universal health insurance—only tangentially related to climate policy. Many top-tier Democratic candidates, who would no doubt balk at such sweeping changes, signed on to the Green New Deal nonetheless. Yet with the release of Mr Biden’s and Ms Warren’s plans, both less quixotic and more scrupulous than the earlier sketch, the debate has been much improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Biden had been one of the few leading presidential contenders to resist endorsing the Green New Deal. He would instead release his own climate plan, he said. An adviser’s comment that Mr Biden was seeking a “middle ground” sparked fears among activists that his would be a mishmash package that offered carbon taxes for liberals and fracking subsidies for conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mr Biden’s plan is ambitious. He would like the American economy to be a net-zero emitter of carbon pollution by 2050. This would be achieved in two ways, including executive orders and actions (taking Barack Obama’s playbook for climate policy and applying it much more aggressively) that would bypass Congress. The second way, which would require legislation, is through a $1.7trn in federal funding for what Mr Biden calls, in a Sandersesque turn of phrase, a “Clean Energy Revolution”. There are other sensible proposals—finally developing the high-speed rail that America lacks, and reforming zoning to encourage denser, more efficient cities—scattered throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One innovation, which seems to play to Mr Biden’s strengths as a foreign-policy expert, is to threaten tariffs on countries without adequate environmental policies. America accounts for only 15% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. China accounts for nearly twice that. Mr Biden’s language on this—he says he wants “strong new measures to stop other countries from cheating on their climate commitments”—sounds almost Trumpian. Given that Mr Biden is the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, this perhaps paves the way for a future attack on the president for focusing his trade actions on the wrong problem. Climate change is a much more serious problem for America’s future than illegal immigration or bilateral trade deficits, Mr Biden could credibly argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Warren’s plan has a Trumpian echo, too: it was released under the banner of “economic patriotism”. It represents, according to her, “my commitment to a Green New Deal”—one that applies the analogy of wartime mobilisation during Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency to modern times. Hers is straightforward industrial policy—calling for $2trn in investments over the next 10 years for research and development—with three-quarters of that vast sum spent through federal procurement. Ms Warren thinks that all that production would generate 1m jobs, which would pay at least $15 per hour and guarantee 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. About $100bn of the money would be spent on a “Green Marshall Plan”, dedicated to exporting the clean-energy technology developed in America to other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curious thing about both proposals is that they dodge the question of a price on carbon, whether through direct taxation or a cap-and-trade scheme. Though research into more cost-effective technology for carbon capture and sequestration or solar power is helpful and necessary, a carbon price incorporating the negative externality of pollution would seem a simple first step. Mr Biden’s plan only nebulously nods towards “the principles that polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting” and says nothing more on the subject. It goes unmentioned in Ms Warren’s plan. Both candidates presumably employ clever policy staffers who know about carbon pricing—but they also employ strategists who note that carbon taxes are quite easily dismissed as energy taxes by political opponents. The lessons of 2010, when a Democratic effort to create a carbon market spectacularly collapsed despite unified control of government leading to an electoral backlash, seem to have been well-remembered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 02:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Britain’s major parties are weaker than ever before]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/07/britains-major-parties-are-weaker-than-ever-before]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_woc221_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-07T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 7th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PREDICTING EARTHQUAKES is doomed to failure, as seismologists well know. But some political earthquakes are a different matter. In the early hours of June 7th, the Brexit Party’s candidate, Mike Greene, came close to winning the first seat in Parliament for a party that was created just two months earlier. He fell just 683 votes short of Labour’s winning candidate in a by-election in Peterborough (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/britain/2019/06/07/labour-holds-peterborough-slowing-the-brexit-partys-momentum&quot;&gt;see article&lt;/a&gt;).

Even then, Labour and the Tories still had 65% of the vote in the election—25 percentage points higher than today’s share. The two big parties risk being overtaken by the upstart Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats, who enjoyed a revival in last month’s local and European elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trends in party support now look more like the wobbly lines of a seismometer than the decades-old separation between the two biggest parties and the rest. Brexit is the main cause of their instability. Historically, the Conservatives and Labour have fought elections mainly on domestic issues, such as levels of government spending and the National Health Service. But the vote to leave the European Union in a referendum in 2016 opened a new fault-line within the country and within both main parties. As Britain polarises over Brexit, a growing number of voters want parties that represent clear, stark views of EU membership: leave without a deal, or reverse the referendum and remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the culmination of social changes that have been taking place since the 1980s, and reflect striking differences between old and young, and between university graduates and the poorly educated. But the two main parties have so been able to rely on Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system—which penalises smaller parties—to hold on to a disproportionate share of seats in Parliament. Given the state of the polls, as well as the results from Peterborough, their supremacy is at stake. Rob Ford, a political scientist at Manchester University, says that the biggest barrier to a political realignment in Britain is in convincing voters that third parties are viable, but “If people stop believing that the major parties are the only ones that can fly, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.” A great tectonic shift is underway in British politics. Whether Labour and the Tories survive the earthquake will depend on how well they can adjust to the shifting ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 02:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why spoilers are ruining storytelling]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/06/07/why-spoilers-are-ruining-storytelling]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190608_BKP512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-07T17:09:02Z&quot;&gt;Jun 7th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE first few decades of cinema, patrons would buy a ticket that granted general admission to the theatre. Several features would be playing on a loop, and you could choose whichever you fancied. You might enter halfway through the main movie, watch it until the end, see the cartoons and the newsreel and then start from the beginning to catch what you’d missed. It functioned rather like a big public television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 1960, a director decreed that no one would be permitted to enter screenings once his new film had begun: the integrity of the viewing experience was paramount. The film was “Psycho” and Alfred Hitchcock’s edict—part artistic statement, part marketing ploy—placed new emphasis on plot twists in the final act. (He also asked critics not to discuss those key details.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, writers and film-makers are obsessed with spoilers. J.K. Rowling has urged those watching “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”, a stage play, or the new “Fantastic Beasts” films to “keep the secrets”. Anthony and Joseph Russo, the directors of Marvel films, have issued statements requesting that fans not ruin them for others. When “Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood” screened in Cannes, a similar plea from Quentin Tarantino was read to the press, to much exasperated booing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audiences are zealous about the matter, too. Many viewers will go offline prior to episodes of a favourite television show, or mute certain words on social media so as to avoid seeing potentially spoiling posts. Writers must declare that their review contains spoilers, or face a backlash. One fan was assaulted outside a screening of “Avengers: Endgame” for “loudly revealing” the movie’s outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narratives have always had twists and unforeseen turns. “Citizen Kane” (1941) reveals a crucial detail in the last minute; whodunnits keep audiences guessing until a last gasp-inducing denouement . Yet Michael Curtiz didn’t ban viewers from entering “Mildred Pierce” (1945) late, nor did Orson Welles embargo the press on matters relating to “Rosebud”. Surprises were there to be had, certainly, but they weren’t particularly treasured or protected. (A notable exception is a production of “The Mousetrap” on the West End, which for decades has asked its patrons to keep quiet.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In films of the 1990s such as “The Crying Game”, “Seven”, “The Usual Suspects” and “Fight Club”, the twist ending came of age; M. Night Shyamalan, a writer and director, became something of a master of the form. The ascendancy of the twist coincided with the spread of the internet, and the spoiler hysteria began. With so much analysis of films and television online, new rules of debate were inaugurated whereby warnings must be given about spoilers, or readers must be allowed to opt in to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Film-makers realised that fans were invested in the surprise and pandered to them. Joseph McGinty Nichol released false spoilers for “Terminator: Salvation”; other directors shot multiple endings for their films. “The Last Watch”, a documentary about the making of the last season of “Game of Thrones”, shows scripts being shredded following the cast read-through and actors being flown out for needless location shoots to mislead journalists and fans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all rather ridiculous—and cynical. Shocking plots are what get people talking, tweeting and tuning in. In television, they help to guarantee huge ratings on the day of broadcast. The hubbub encourages fans to book their cinema tickets in advance. The Russo brothers begging viewers not to ruin the Avengers films probably helped them to secure the biggest opening weekend in film history. See it now, that seemed to say, or have someone else spoil it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This attitude stifles proper discussion of stories by critics as much as viewers, and it inflicts damage on storytelling as a craft. By promoting one technique, the twist, and one effect, surprise, stories get bent out of shape. They try too hard to counter expectation and resist predictability. “The Lord of the Rings” is totally predictable from beginning to end, but the series does not suffer for it. William Shakespeare gave away the end of his tragedies by billing them as such and no one seemed to mind (“Romeo and Juliet” even told the audience the story in a prologue). “Columbo”, a classic crime serial, reveals who commited the murder at the beginning of each episode and succeeded in making the investigation thrilling to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories that promote surprise over character end up as mere soap opera, a series of sensational shocks. That corrodes credibility, while some reveals—they were all dead! it was all a dream!—do not so much blow minds as waste time. More significant than all of this, though, is the fact that surprise is overrated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611417007&quot;&gt;A study carried out by Jonathan Leavitt and Nicholas Christenfeld&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 found that knowing how the story ends doesn’t hamper enjoyment—it increases it. In other words, spoilers don’t spoil anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:40:30 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The second half of the internet revolution, Sudan&#x27;s Tiananmen and baseball&#x27;s exceptionalism]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/07/the-second-half-of-the-internet-revolution-sudans-tiananmen-and-baseballs-exceptionalism]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/editors_picks_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-07T16:50:43Z&quot;&gt;Jun 7th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SELECTION of three essential articles read aloud from the latest issue of The Economist.

Lisa Forbes held onto the seat for the Labour Party, beating the Brexit Party party’s candidate, Mike Greene, into second place. The party’s leader, Nigel Farage, who briefly made an appearance at the count, retreated with his tail between his legs and a question mark hanging over his political project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brexit Party was registered only four months ago, born out of frustration that Britain has so far missed all its deadlines to leave the European Union. After a stunning victory in the European elections on May 23rd, winning almost one third of the popular vote, many were predicting a win for the upstarts in Peterborough. But if the Brexit Party cannot win a seat in a constituency that voted 61% for Leave in the referendum of 2016, and that had just booted out its sitting MP for criminal activity, when will it be able to win its first seat at Westminster? The Liberal Democrats failed to repeat their impressive performance in last month’s European elections and managed to come only fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The by-election was a triumph of old-style political loyalties. Many psephologists have taken to arguing that Leave and Remain are beginning to trump left and right as the lodestars of political loyalty. But Labour succeeded in keeping the seat, despite both the criminal antics of its previous MP (Fiona Onasanya had conspired with her brother-in-law to claim that he was driving her car in order to save her from getting points on her licence), and efforts by two challenging parties, the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats, to seduce its Leave and Remain supporters respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The by-election was also a triumph of old-fashioned shoe-leather politics. The Labour Party demonstrated that it is still a master of traditional get-out-the-vote politics: targeting likely voters, knocking on doors, demonstrating command of local issues, mixing national stars such as Angela Rayner with local activists and, above all, getting supporters to the polls on election day. The Brexit Party showed that its mastery of the new politics of social media and cultural polarisation that served it so well in the European elections (where people are voting for lists of candidates in giant constituencies) doesn’t translate into Westminster politics (where people are voting for particular MPs). Though Mr Farage promised that “we will be back”, his chances of winning Peterborough in a general election, where turn-out is routinely higher than yesterday’s 48%, will be slim unless he can build an old-fashioned political machine of local activists. There is a big difference between running a political party and running a glorified pressure group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all that it was a close-run thing. The Labour Party poured massive national resources into the constituency, something that it wouldn’t be able to replicate in a general election. Even so, it managed to defeat the Brexit Party by only 638 votes, and saw its own share of the vote share fall by 17 percentage points from the 2017 general election. Given the dismal state of Britain’s Conservative government, with Brexit undelivered and the party engaged in a bloody leadership contest, this is hardly a ringing endorsement of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two biggest losers from the by-election were arguably the Conservative Party and the People’s Vote campaign. The Conservatives came a dismal third—the first time the party has failed to come in the top two in Peterborough since the introduction of the universal franchise in 1918—and saw its vote share fall by 25 percentage points from the last general election. This is perhaps a fitting political epitaph for Theresa May, who steps down as leader of the party on June 7th after three years characterised by a toxic combination of hubris, dithering and poor judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party’s poor performance will reinforce the conviction that it has to push Brexit through, or see the Brexit Party syphon off many of its natural supporters, split the right-wing vote and put Mr Corbyn in Downing Street. The chairman of the Peterborough Conservative Association, Wayne Fitzgerald, said the result proved it was essential that the party commit to taking Britain out of the EU, even if it means doing so with no deal. (It is notable that, taken together, the Conservative and Brexit parties took 50% of the vote, to Labour’s 31%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People’s Vote campaign has been putting enormous pressure on Mr Corbyn to make Labour a Remain party that campaigns vigorously for a second referendum. But the fact that Labour has held a seat in a Leave-voting constituency against strong pressure from the Brexit Party will vindicate Mr Corbyn’s strategy of fudging on Brexit and fighting the war on Labour’s strongest fronts, public services and economic justice. Remainers may celebrate the fact that Mr Farage’s forces were defeated. But the result will also make both main parties more anxious to press on with getting Brexit out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 22:40:12 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“It’s been a farce”—Britain’s leadership contest]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/07/its-been-a-farce-britains-leadership-contest]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190608_blm513.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-07T11:30:01Z&quot;&gt;Jun 7th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THERESA MAY stepped down&lt;/strong&gt; today as leader of the &lt;strong&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/strong&gt;, and would-be replacements are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/britain/2019/06/08/rory-stewart-odd-man-out&quot;&gt;lining up&lt;/a&gt;.
