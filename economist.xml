Like all who are confined at the Allan B. Polunsky Unit, he is dressed in white. The prison’s squat, grey buildings hold 214 death-row inmates. Locked into a tiny booth in a visiting room, handcuffs off, he compares being “out here” to a vacation. It is quiet, save clangs of metal doors. The room is also cooled and, a rarity, he can see through Plexiglass to the face of another human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was convicted in 1996, aged 21, for a drive-by shooting that killed two children at a New Year’s party. Since then, for 23 years, he has been awaiting execution. In Texas the death penalty is applied to those found guilty of the most heinous crimes; judges may also consider who was judged to be a threat to others. Mr Medina’s legal appeals are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deafening wall of noise was “my clearest first memory of death row”, he says. “It’s gates slamming, the steel on steel, prisons are all concrete and steel, so it echoes, echoes, echoes. It never stops.” On his first night he was placed in a darkened wing of shouting inmates, a dumbfounding experience, “like Thunderdome-type noise, yelling and screaming and banging and everything multiplied”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on he shared a cell. Then, after other prisoners tried an escape in 1998, all death-row inmates were shifted to solitary. He complains this is agony. “I wasn’t sentenced to solitary confinement. I was sentenced to death.” Every day since, for 19 years, he has been alone for 23 hours inside a concrete box measuring 7 feet by 11 feet. Guards pass trays of food through a slat in a door. Standing on his bed he can peer from a vent-window, a few inches high, near the ceiling. “Some guys spend all day long” doing so, he says. He never does, shunning “what is out there that I can’t touch”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gets an hour in an enclosed yard, most days, for recreation. Again he is alone. In his cell he reads (at the moment a series about survivalists), writes or sometimes paints. Relations and volunteers, mostly European women, visit and send messages. Inmates shout to each other, cell-to-cell. But Texas, unlike some states, denies solitary prisoners any physical contact, other than frequent body inspections by guards. He says he last touched a relative, hugging his mother, on August 1st 1996. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has a lack of human contact changed him? He describes “feeling alone, a sense of feeling abandoned”, describes himself withdrawing, growing less active, going for days without speaking, losing the urge to do recreation or to read. Other states with the death penalty, and federal prisons, have less strict conditions. In many, young inmates and those with mental-health problems are no longer isolated for long. Even Texas, with more prisoners in solitary than any other state—about 4,200 as of 2017—is reducing its numbers. A report in 2018 by the Liman Centre at Yale University estimated 61,000 inmates were kept isolated across America, of whom about 37% had endured six months or more. That tally is probably lower today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Medina believes Texas goes on isolating its death-row prisoners out of vindictiveness, not because of security. He calls the practice outright “torture”, “cruel and inhumane”, a means of “intimidation to break a person mentally” before his execution. (On average a death-row prisoner in Texas waits nearly 11 years before being put to death; the longest wait was 31 years.) It is hard to dispute his claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis Longmire, of Sam Houston State University in nearby Huntsville, says prolonged use of solitary cells is costly and needless. The UN and advocacy groups routinely condemn the practice. He has testified at 40 trials that older inmates are not especially violent to others. He recalls that his own visits to death row were deafening and unpleasant. Unsurprisingly, many guards demand to work elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many inmates suffer mental deterioration, and some turn to suicide, says Mr Medina, telling of his once “solid” immediate neighbour who broke after 15 years in his box. Prisoners grow anxious from isolation and sensory deprivation, or grow obsessed by what they see as official petty malevolence. For example, inmates in Polunsky were refused the right to buy nail clippers for 17 years. Nor are inmates supposed to decorate their cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some crack while waiting for execution. When close friends are taken away—sometimes noisily resisting—for lethal injections, there is added turmoil. He counts 437 executions in Texas since he arrived on death row, including “guys that I’ve considered brothers”. It is especially distressing, he says, hearing guards chat and joke as condemned men are removed for execution. Many inmates arrive with mental difficulties. One death-row inmate in Polunsky, Andre Thomas, notoriously gouged out his own eyes and ate one. He has been moved to a psychiatric unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conversation Mr Medina is articulate and measured, but he says isolated confinement takes a toll. He experiences intense rage, which he calls beneficial, towards “the system—the way I hold onto my sanity is by reminding myself to be angry at the people that put me here.” The anger helped him “build a lot of walls very high in my mind”, but “it’s not very healthy” for it “can eat at you”. He has heard of inmates in Texas, released from solitary, unable to bear living among other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His response echoes the words of Albert Woodfox, a prisoner kept in solitary confinement in Louisiana for 43 years before being released in 2016, aged 69. Mr Woodfox recently published a book, “Solitary”, in which he writes that “the fight for sanity never goes away” and he says he “shut my emotional system down” to cope with being locked away alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue is not whether to punish the guilty—though Mr Woodfox did eventually prove he had been wrongfully convicted. It is whether America should treat even its hardest prisoners like this. “I feel like we’re seen in the same light as places like China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. That’s the company we keep,” says Mr Medina. “Human beings are not meant to be isolated in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 17:40:15 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Under left or right, Denmark is set to adopt ever harsher policies against migrants]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/06/04/under-left-or-right-denmark-will-get-ever-tougher-with-migrants]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_eup502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-04T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 4th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR A striking example of how far-right parties can change the politics of a democratic Western country, even without ever holding office, look no further than to wealthy, well-ordered Denmark. The anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party (DPP), which was first elected to the Danish parliament in 1998, has relentlessly pushed mainstream parties into adopting ever harsher policies towards immigrants, often Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general election, which takes place on June 5th, will confirm the trend. The country of 5.7m has been ruled since 2015 by a centre-right alliance led by the Venstre party under the prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Lacking a majority, Mr Rasmussen has had to rely on the votes of the DPP (which also supported centre-right governments between 2001 and 2011).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venstre is polling at just 18%, and will probably lose to the Social Democrats (SD), on 29%. The SD ruled Denmark for most of the 20th century and built much of its generous welfare state. But don’t expect it to bring much change when it comes to dealing with foreigners. In the bidding war for Denmark’s increasingly strident anti-immigrant vote, the SD is promising more limits on foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DPP’s influence has helped to normalise xenophobic and Islamophobic sentiments. Last year Mr Rasmussen rolled out a plan to banish asylum-seekers to an isolated island, once used as a research centre for contagious diseases in animals, if they cannot be deported because of humanitarian concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parliament has passed laws banning women from wearing the burqa or other face coverings in public. It allows officials to confiscate cash, jewellery and other valuables from asylum-seekers, supposedly to pay for the cost of their upkeep in asylum centres. This year it approved a “paradigm shift” under which the country’s asylum policy will focus on repatriation instead of integration. This means the government can deport refugees whose countries it deems safe enough, such as Somalia (even though a Danish delegation that visited the country in 2015 to assess its security situation did not dare leave the airport).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Rasmussen also announced a policy to eradicate “ghettos” by 2030. Denmark defines these as neighbourhoods with lower income and education levels, and higher unemployment and crime rates, than the national average, and over 50% “non-Western” residents. Seeking to avoid the creation of “parallel societies”, the policy forces such areas to cut social housing to 40% of the total housing stock. For example, in Tingbjerg, a suburb of Copenhagen classified as a “hard ghetto”, all homes are social housing. Local housing associations are required to demolish buildings, build new private homes or sell property to investors. The policy also demands that children in these areas must attend publicly funded nurseries and take classes in “Danish values”, or risk losing benefits. Those who commit crimes in the “ghettos” will face harsher punishments than if they commit them elsewhere. Critics say that the policy places a stigma on immigrants; they argue that blaming foreigners ignores the underlying reasons for Denmark’s social problems, such as unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to parties on the left in other Nordic countries, such as Sweden and Finland, the SD has proposed taking these policies even further. Even as she steers her party further to the left economically—pledging to raise taxes on the rich, for instance—the SD leader, Mette Frederiksen (pictured), is moving to the right on immigration. The SD has proposed an annual cap on “non-Western” immigration, and a limit to the share of “non-Western” students that schools are allowed to enrol at one time. Foreign senior citizens who give up their Danish residency would be allowed to take their state pensions with them if they moved back to their countries of origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Frederiksen has even flirted with the idea of co-operating with the DPP if she wins power. If you can’t beat them, join them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 17:40:14 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virginia’s governor calls for tougher gun laws]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/06/04/virginias-governor-calls-for-tougher-gun-laws]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190608_USP503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-04T19:27:11Z&quot;&gt;Jun 4th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ON MAY 31st a gunman walked into a municipal office in Virginia Beach and slaughtered 12 people, most of them colleagues he had worked with for years, before he was killed in a gun battle with police. The killer—whom the police have referred to by name only once, part of a move to strip mass shooters of their notoriety—used two semi-automatic handguns, both bought legally. He also used a silencer and extended ammunition magazines, which are also legal in Virginia. It seems likely that his presence, heavily armed, in the building, was also above board. Thanks to the state’s liberal concealed-carry laws anyone with a licence can walk into a restaurant, shop or office in Virginia carrying a gun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four days later, Ralph Northam, Virginia’s governor, said he would recall lawmakers to the state Capitol in June to debate a package of gun-control measures. It included, he said, a ban on silencers and high capacity ammunition magazines and new powers for local governments to limit guns in city buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is wrong, it is outrageous, it is unforgivable to turn our municipal centers, our schools, our churches and synagogues and mosques, into battlefields,” he said at a news conference on June 4th. “I will be asking for votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Northam, a Democrat who has long been an advocate of stricter gun controls, said he also wanted lawmakers to vote on bills to compel gun buyers to undergo universal background checks, to limit gun purchases to one a month, and to allow authorities to seize the weapons of those deemed a threat. He said that while mass shootings made headlines, far more Virginians were killed in smaller incidents—1,028 in 2017 alone. He cited the case of a little girl who was shot dead in a park last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years after a student at Virginia Tech killed 32 and wounded 17 with two semi-automatic pistols in a 10-minute rampage in 2007, Virginia has yet to pass any of the stringent gun regulations that have cut gun deaths elsewhere. It is one of 17 states in which more people are killed by guns than car crashes, according to the Centre for American Progress, a think tank. In 2012 Virginia’s lawmakers repealed a law, passed in the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre, which prevented the purchase of more than one gun per person per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Northam, a doctor who has described treating children and soldiers for bullet wounds, made gun-control a big issue in his campaign for the governorship in 2017. But his efforts have so far failed. Republicans, who hold narrow majorities in Virginia’s House and Senate, have blocked all such efforts, including a push, in January, to ban high-capacity magazines. “They have never received a fair hearing”, Mr Northam said. “I want these pieces of common sense gun safety legislation to get to the floor and let these individuals elected by you, the people, to come to the floor and cast their vote.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Republican lawmaker did indicate that he was willing to debate gun controls. Addressing a group of protesters who had gathered outside his office to call for gun controls, Thomas Norment, the majority leader in the state Senate, said “there ought to be a meaningful discussion legislatively and in the community about gun control.” But he is also reported to have told the protestors that “nothing would have helped us at Virginia Beach”. The House Speaker, Kirk Cox, meanwhile, described Mr Northam’s announcement as “hasty and suspect when considered against the backdrop of the last few months”—apparently alluding to revelations in February that Mr Northam had donned blackface as a student. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Northam may have more luck with his gun-control push next year. Since 2016, when Hillary Clinton won Virginia, Democrats have stormed elections in the state, taking its three elective offices—governor, lieutenant-governor and attorney-general—and three congressional seats. In November, all seats in the general assembly will be up for election. With Republicans holding a two-seat majority in the House and Senate, Democrats are hoping to flip both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 05:40:21 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Under left or right, Denmark is set to adopt ever harsher policies against migrants]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/06/04/under-left-or-right-denmark-is-set-to-adopt-ever-harsher-policies-against-migrants]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_eup502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-04T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 4th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR A striking example of how far-right parties can change the politics of a democratic Western country, even without ever holding office, look no further than to wealthy, well-ordered Denmark.

The resulting steam explosion at the plant near the city of Pripyat, 70 miles north of Kiev, spewed out so much radiation that much of the surrounding area will be uninhabitable for 20,000 years. Harmful isotopes were carried by the winds as far as Ireland within a week. According to some accounts, first responders who were exposed to large doses of radiation suffered agonising deaths. These events, as well as the political intrigue of the Soviet government’s actions, are the subject of HBO’s historical drama series, “Chernobyl”. Following the final episode, which aired in America on June 3rd, it is the highest-rated television series of all time, according to crowd-sourced reviews on IMDb, a film and television rating site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers have given the miniseries stellar ratings. A weighted average of all five episodes calculated by &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; (according to how recently each episode ran and the number of reviews) accords it 9.7 points out of 10. By the same measure, other leading shows—including comparable historical drama series such as “The Crown” and “The People v. O. J. Simpson” (now called “American Crime Story”)—lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more, every episode of “Chernobyl” has been rated by IMDb users at 9.5 or higher, a unique streak. According to &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis of 518 episodes of popular television dramas, the likelihood that any show would produce even four consecutive episodes that each score a 9.5 or above is roughly 0.4%. Apart from “Chernobyl”, only the final four episodes of “Breaking Bad”—previously the highest-rated show—had accomplished this feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is even more impressive given its subject matter. Documentaries typically struggle to gain as much attention as action and fantasy shows such as “Game of Thrones”, and the same is true of historical dramas. Even series about well-known subjects, such as Queen Elizabeth II or the trial of O.J. Simpson, earn user ratings that are typically below those of the most popular shows. In comparison, “Chernobyl” scores better than the greats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show has also caused a massive spike in interest about the actual disaster.

He certainly likes the pomp and ceremony of foreign monarchies. His first trip abroad as president was to Saudi Arabia, where he took part in a sword dance with King Salman and other Gulf royals. In Japan last month he was treated to a six-course black-tie banquet with Emperor Naruhito, complete with Mt. Fuji-shaped ice cream (not to mention playing golf and watching a sumo match with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe). Making a state visit to Britain, starting on June 3rd, Mr Trump was delighted by his formal dinner with the queen at Buckingham Palace, even though he did not have a procession down the Mall in a gold carriage (for security reasons).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to judge from his Twitter feed, at least, Mr Trump’s mind is mostly elsewhere when he thinks about the globe. Worldmapper, an academic mapping outfit, analysed nearly 8,300 tweets issued by Mr Trump between his election in November 2016 and May this year. Of these, 1,384 mentioned foreign countries. The president’s &lt;em&gt;idée fixe&lt;/em&gt; is Russia, which he has mentioned in 297 tweets, although this may have more to do with his loathing for Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election than with the president’s admiration for Vladimir Putin, the Russian strongman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea—whose leader, Kim Jong Un, Mr Trump has met twice—figured in 163 tweets. The United Kingdom, which enjoys a “special relationship” with America, was mentioned just 22 times, behind both France (37) and Germany (29). Japan has been mentioned 43 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that being mentioned in Mr Trump’s tweets is necessarily a sign of friendship. Often the opposite is true. Moments before touching down at Stansted Airport, the president was already on Twitter, issuing a bilious message denouncing Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, as a “stone cold loser” (no doubt in response to Mr Khan’s criticism of the presidential visit). During his stay in London, Mr Trump harrumphed about Mexico, declaring that it “immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border.” But Britain’s monarch, at least, seems to have soothed his spirits: “London part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 02:40:11 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why the EU’s sea-rescue mission has no boats]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/06/04/why-the-eus-sea-rescue-mission-has-no-boats]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_BLP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-04T16:28:29Z&quot;&gt;Jun 4th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT IS one thing to be tasked with saving the lives of vulnerable migrants in the Mediterranean. It is another thing altogether to try to do this without any boats. But this is the job that confronts Vice-Admiral Enrico Credendino, the commander of Operation Sophia, a naval mission organised by the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mission was established in 2015 as part of the EU’s response to a crisis that saw over a million undocumented migrants enter Europe that year. A large contingent came from Syria, via Turkey and Greece, but many Africans also made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from Libya in search of a better life. Operation Sophia, launched at the behest of the Italian government but with support across the EU, was supposed to be a military mission. Supplied, at first, with 19 boats, its objective was to disrupt people-traffickers, many of whom were operating out of Libya. It trained the Libyan coastguard and navy, and helped implement a UN arms embargo off the coast. But in practice, the mission (named after a baby girl born on a rescue boat) was also a humanitarian operation. It has rescued over 44,000 people at sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Operation Sophia has become the victim of an anti-migrant backlash in Europe and of quarrels about the regulations governing disembarkation and asylum within the EU. Most people rescued in the Mediterranean have been brought ashore in Italy. Under EU law known as the Dublin regulation, Italy has been responsible for taking care of rescued people and processing their asylum applications. An increasingly frustrated and now populist government in Rome is using Operation Sophia as leverage to try and force their European neighbours to agree on changes to the Dublin regulation. In December, after European ministers failed to agree on where rescue services should take migrants ashore, Italy said the rescued could no longer come to their ports. Germany in turn withdrew its boat from the project, out of apparent frustration with Mr Salvini’s policy. Over months, the project had become more difficult to operate. But rather than ending Operation Sophia altogether, ministers agreed on an unhappy compromise in March: the mission could continue, but without any vessels on the water. It now relies on aeroplanes and the Libyan coastguard to do the job of disrupting smuggling networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years migrants seeking to enter Europe have shifted the focus of their attention. In 2016 8,000 arrived by sea in Spain; in 2018 59,000 did. And those who still try to cross the central Mediterranean are attempting longer, more dangerous journeys in flimsier craft that they can hide more easily. As a result the fatality rate for this group is already seven times higher this year than it was in 2018. Human-rights groups also worry that EU co-operation with the Libyan coastguard may be harmful to migrants. They are no longer taken to Italy but are placed in Libyan detention centres where there is a high likelihood of torture, sexual violence, extortion and forced labour. All of which leaves European leaders facing tricky decisions. They may be having some success in reducing the number of undocumented migrants reaching Europe via the central Mediterranean, but the risks to those who choose to make the trip remain considerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A fictionalised biography of David Hockney]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/06/04/a-fictionalised-biography-of-david-hockney]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_bkp505.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-04T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 4th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life of David Hockney: A Novel.&lt;/strong&gt; By Catherine Cusset. Translated by Teresa Lavender Fagan. &lt;em&gt;Other Press; 192 pages; $15.99 and £12.99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;READING “LIFE OF DAVID HOCKNEY” somehow mimics the experience of looking at a painting by the artist. Famous for his bright, flat compositions, Mr Hockney re-energised figurative painting at a time when most of his contemporaries considered it “anti-modern”. Catherine Cusset’s writing, translated from the French by Teresa Lavender Fagan, echoes that vivid style. The author moves swiftly through Mr Hockney’s life, painting a fictional portrait of his adolescence in working-class Yorkshire through to his globe-trotting adulthood as one of Britain’s most famous living artists. The result is a compelling picture of a man who himself changed portraiture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing an imagined biography of a living artist is a risky move, and perhaps a strange one (novels about dead figures are more common). In her introduction to the English edition, Ms Cusset explains simply that Mr Hockney’s life took hold of her. “When I read about him, something happened. He started to live in my head like a character.” In her writing, the character of Hockney comes fully to life, too. The flesh-and-blood painter agreed to have lunch with Ms Cusset after reading the book, and though she doesn’t include Mr Hockney’s verdict in her introduction, the lunch sounds pleasant enough to indicate that he liked the novel, or, at the very least, appreciated its artifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, Mr Hockney himself is a master of reconstructing the real. Early in the novel, Hockney has a revelation: “Nature and artifice were thus not at odds, any more than were the figurative and abstraction, poetry and graffiti, quotes and originality, playing and reality.” This idea frees him to paint what he wants: California swimming pools, gay couples and naked men, all in bright hues. It also seems to free Ms Cusset to combine the facts of Mr Hockney’s life with her own imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her telling, Hockney is an eternal innocent, almost a Peter Pan figure. He devotes his life in equal measure to art and to the dream of “free love, without ties, without jealousy, without guilt. Just pleasure to give and receive.” Ms Cusset never romanticises this dream. Instead, she traces its progression from idealism to selfishness. By middle age, her Hockney has forgotten how love works, refusing to feel guilt and refusing to take responsibility. It takes a teenager to remind him, with “the clarity of childhood”, that he has to treat others as people, not as subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Cusset writes with a nearly childish clarity, too, and the result is both unsettling and effective. For much of the novel, she describes Hockney’s emotions with unusual baldness, flattening his inner life. Like Mr Hockney, she mixes lush visuals with pervasive melancholy, and as her subject reaches belated maturity, her prose grows increasingly nuanced. By the book’s end, the great painter feels fragile and accessible, both a legend and a fallible man. This trajectory mirrors Mr Hockney’s artistic process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Cusset sees Hockney as using portraiture as a way of coming to terms with his life. With “Portrait of an Artist”, he grapples with the failure of his first relationship by painting his ex-boyfriend “as an artist, not as a lover”. In “My Parents”, he allows himself to show the elder Hockneys “chained together, but separated, each enclosed in his or her solitude”. These are emotional, exposed paintings: looking at them feels intimate, sometimes to an unsettling degree. The same could be said of Ms Cusset’s novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advertising may make people miserable, but still has its uses]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/06/04/advertising-may-make-people-miserable-but-still-has-its-uses]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_fnd000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-04T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 4th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVERY YEAR, as Americans polish off their Thanksgiving feasts, a particular type of television advertisement begins to air. The details vary, but the plot is always the same: one family member surprises another with the Christmas gift of a luxury car, often adorned with a cartoonishly large bow. The recipient never betrays a hint of the dismay one might expect to see on the face of someone whose partner has without consultation spent tens of thousands of dollars. Such a car can easily cost more than the median annual income of an American household, and most people who see these ads will not be able to afford one. But the envy such spots induce serves an economic purpose, even as it leaves the majority feeling worse about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads and other forms of marketing ostensibly serve a straightforward economic role. Firms selling goods and services need to tell consumers about the availability and desirability of their wares, and spend on advertising to do so. By informing consumers about the relative merits of various products, ads improve the quality of purchasing decisions and, conceivably, leave both firms and shoppers better off than they would be in an ad-free world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are many ways in which advertising might fall short of this ideal. It need not be honest or representative of the full range of available products, for example. Some firms target impressionable children, in ways which could contribute to long-run health risks. And honest or not, successful ads induce a desire to spend, potentially on things the audience does not need or cannot afford. The information content of advertisements for fancy vacations, bespoke cars or diamond-studded watches does not much matter for people whose budgets cannot accommodate them. Their main takeaway is that others get to enjoy things that they themselves cannot afford. If the effect of advertising is mostly to encourage people to want things that they cannot have, rather than to direct them toward items that are a good match for their needs and tastes, then it is possible that spending on advertising leaves society worse off overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests this might indeed be the case. A forthcoming paper by Chloé Michel, now at Swiss Re, Michelle Sovinsky of Mannheim University, Eugenio Proto of Bristol University and Andrew Oswald of Warwick University attempts to unpick the effect of advertising on welfare. The researchers used three decades’ worth of survey results from a sample of nearly 1m Europeans, spread across 27 countries, to compare information on self-reported life satisfaction with variation in total advertising spending as a share of GDP. After taking account of other macroeconomic variables such as unemployment, and individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics, they find a significant and inverse relationship between spending on advertisements and national welfare. They estimate that a doubling of ad spending is associated with a subsequent drop in reported satisfaction of 3%—an effect about a quarter as strong as a spell of unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this result reflects the effect of some other factor which influences both advertising and well-being. And the authors are careful to note that they cannot be certain about the causal mechanism at work. But their findings may illustrate an aspect of the economy that has puzzled some economists for more than a century. In “The Theory of the Leisure Class”, published in 1899, Thorstein Veblen, a Norwegian-American economist, explored the nature of what he termed “conspicuous consumption”. Veblen argued that consumption is not merely about satisfying needs, but is also used to signal status and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The priciest cars may offer more nifty features and a smoother ride than a cheaper marque, but the vast difference in price is not primarily down to such advantages. Rather, the buyer is paying for such cars’ value as a status symbol, which derives from the fact that very few people can afford one. (Following his insight, economists use the name “Veblen good” for items for which demand rises with price, though it is not the high price itself that generates the increased demand but rather the exclusivity that the high price confers.) These luxury items defy normal economic logic. In the mass market, productivity-boosting innovations that allow firms to sell better products at lower prices are a route to success. For producers of conspicuous-consumption items, such cost-cutting does not conquer the market but destroys it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less good than a feast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion that people might buy high-cost items in preference to serviceable alternatives simply to set themselves apart from the less well-off would seem absurd, were the economy not chock-a-block with examples, from designer handbags to silver cutlery to oxygenated energy drinks. Advertising enables the process. For goods to grant high status, there must be consumers who want but cannot have them. Ad campaigns featuring sleek cars bedecked with oversized bows add to the value of luxury brands by informing the masses of how desirable they are—and how inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veblen, though, saw the rich as a largely unproductive class of capital-owning moochers, who profited off the useful labour of working people (hence, the “leisure class”). In recent decades, however, the share of Americans working long hours has grown, and has risen fastest among those earning the highest wages—an odd exception to the global norm that working time declines with income. The status envy induced by conspicuous consumption may play a role. In rich countries, most people’s basic needs have long since been met. To keep workers striving—those on higher incomes especially—there must always be more desirable consumer goods and services just out of reach. Perpetual dissatisfaction might well boost economic growth by keeping highly productive workers who might otherwise enjoy more time with their families chained to their desks. But it is a funny sort of prosperity that depends on people never being satisfied with their lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
