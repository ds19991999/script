The MPs will then send two names to party members who will make the final choice.

He was 11 when his father sent him from his village to a religious school on the outskirts of Senegal’s holy city of Touba. His teacher made him recite passages from the Koran in the morning. Then Mbar (not his real name) was sent out to the streets to beg for money for his master until night fell. If he misbehaved, he was beaten or starved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years Mbar ran away to his village. But his father sent him to another school. This time he was not made to beg. Instead, he was chained to the classroom wall. “I couldn’t move. They used to bring me a bucket to pee in,” says Mbar, in a cracked voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senegal is one of Africa’s more successful countries. It is peaceful. Its government functions relatively well and the economy is growing at 7% a year. But along the old boulevards of Dakar, the capital, thousands of &lt;em&gt;talibé&lt;/em&gt;—the “seekers” attending nearby religious schools—beg for change. Some boys are as young as four. Many families send their sons to such schools, or &lt;em&gt;daaras&lt;/em&gt;, where they memorise the Koran. Some do so for religious reasons but, for many, &lt;em&gt;daaras&lt;/em&gt; offer the only opportunity for children to get a basic education. Many &lt;em&gt;marabouts&lt;/em&gt;, or religious teachers, respect children’s rights. And begging has long been accepted as a way of teaching &lt;em&gt;talibés&lt;/em&gt; humility and funding their education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because the system is almost completely unregulated, rackets flourish. A new report by PPDH, a coalition of Senegalese rights groups, and Human Rights Watch (HRW) in New York, documents some of the abuse suffered by the estimated 100,000 children who are forced to beg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated far away from home, dozens of boys sleep in filthy rooms. They are given just enough food to survive. If they fail to meet their begging quota of about $1 per day, or try to escape, they may be beaten, starved or chained for weeks at a time. Many are sexually abused. According to a psychologist at Samu Social, a centre working with boys in Dakar, many children try to kill themselves or hurt themselves deliberately so they will need medical attention and can get out of the &lt;em&gt;daaras&lt;/em&gt;. From 2017 to 2018, researchers recorded at least 16 incidents in which children died from beatings, neglect or poor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the boys come from farms or villages in Senegal, but some are also trafficked from the Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Mali. Agents go to rural areas and promise parents that the boys will study at the most prestigious religious schools in Senegal. The costs for the traffickers are minimal. They pay border guards about $1 a child to smuggle them in from Gambia, says Issa Kouyaté, who runs Maison de la Gare, a &lt;em&gt;talibé&lt;/em&gt; shelter in Saint Louis, a city in northern Senegal. Once they get the boys to the major cities, they can make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government officials have repeatedly pledged to deal with the problem but their attempts have been half-hearted, at best. The &lt;em&gt;daaras&lt;/em&gt; are powerful institutions and the &lt;em&gt;marabouts&lt;/em&gt; can influence the way people vote in elections. Politicians and officials compete for their support and are reluctant to interfere in religious affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 a law was drafted which sought to establish minimum standards for &lt;em&gt;daaras&lt;/em&gt;. It is yet to be passed by parliament. In 2016 President Macky Sall spoke about taking the children off the streets and jailing those who forced them to beg. But official figures show that only about 300 children were helped in 2018. Children often beg openly outside police stations and the &lt;em&gt;marabouts&lt;/em&gt; who abuse them rarely face justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this may be storing up trouble for Senegal. “You have a large population of impoverished, abused children, isolated away from their families. I can’t think of a more perfect target population for criminals,” says Jeffrey Bawa of the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, a UN agency, adding that the boys were also likely to be future targets for Islamist recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mbar was chained to the wall for a month. An older, stronger boy kept the keys for the chains in his robe and disciplined the children when the &lt;em&gt;marabout&lt;/em&gt; was away. Mbar saw him rape a younger boy several times. One night when the older boy was sleeping, he left his robe on the floor near Mbar, who found the keys and unlocked himself from the wall. He couldn’t find the key for the chains around his ankles but it was enough. He jumped out of the window and shuffled towards the distant lights of a main road. Strangers helped him out of his chains and took him to a shelter in Dakar. After almost a year of eating good food, he is beginning to grow again and dreams of becoming a footballer. If only Senegal could make similar efforts to leave the &lt;em&gt;talibé&lt;/em&gt; system behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:40:18 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“When their autonomy is undermined they leap up to defend it”—Hong Kong’s protests]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/11/when-their-autonomy-is-undermined-they-leap-up-to-defend-it-hong-kongs-protests]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190615_blm502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-11T11:15:31Z&quot;&gt;Jun 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PROPOSED change to the judicial system is just the latest sign that mainland China is exerting pressure on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/10/china-seems-deaf-to-mass-protests-in-hong-kong-over-extradition&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong’s autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

By 2018 his e-commerce empire, Amazon, would be delivering items by drone. Prime Air has yet to launch. But startups are making progress—mostly in health care, where they are vying to tap into a lucrative, $70bn global market in health-care logistics. As they deal with regulators and investors, these firms are charting the course for other aerial deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best known is Zipline, based in San Francisco, which took off in Rwanda in 2016, where it is now a national on-demand medical drone network, delivering 150 medical products, mostly blood and vaccines, to hard-to-reach places. Maternal mortality rates are declining thanks to the delivery of blood. Other firms have used drones to deliver medicines in Bhutan, Malawi and Papua New Guinea. Patients in many Swiss hospitals can receive results on the day a sample is taken. Zipline is expanding into Ghana and, later this year, into North Carolina, an American state with many out-of-the-way rural medical facilities. It wants to serve 700m people in the next three to four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For governments and regulators nervous about allowing drones to roam the skies, health-care deliveries offer a compelling reason to give it a go. Drones can fall out of the sky, can collide with other air traffic, create perceived privacy concerns and they can be noisy. This is hard to justify when they are delivering a light bulb. When they carry life-saving medicines the calculation is different. It is also easier, says Ben Marcus, founder of AirMap, a drone consultancy, because health-care deliveries typically happen between a limited number of fixed locations, not to and from innumerable doorsteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most fast-growing startups, drone firms are coy about profitability but say they are generating revenue. Investors look convinced. On May 17th Zipline announced $190m in new financing, which values it at $1.2 billion. It and its competitors see lucrative opportunities. For one thing, medical parcels are lightweight but valuable, so drone costs would make up a relatively small portion of the final bill. Drones can also replace stocks of expensive medicines hospitals keep just in case they are needed, by flying them quickly to the hospital bed from a central location. Lightweight electric drones are likely to be less expensive than traditional car or motorcycle courier, and faster. Andreas Raptopoulos, boss of Matternet, another drone-delivery firm, thinks that this could save hospitals millions in lab and pharmacy costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of such efficiency gains (as well as eco-friendliness) was factor in the partnership between Swiss Post and Matternet. Drones now service three cities in Switzerland. Swiss Post says journeys of 45 minutes have been reduced to flights of a few minutes. Matternet is, like Zipline, moving into North Carolina, whose local transport authority has championed drone delivery. UPS, a big delivery company, is using Matternet’s drones to replace some courier cars to move medical samples across the state. UPS lags behind Swiss Post in drone delivery but hopes that experience in health care will lay the groundwork for national expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of drone deliveries of all kinds in America, and elsewhere, rests with regulators. In less-developed countries the skies are empty and permission to fly can be granted by a single person. In developed countries, with their more crowded airspace and thicker rule books, everything takes longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current buzz in America is down to a pilot programme by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which hopes this will help it develop a regulatory framework. As part of the project, Zipline is expected next week to announce its plans direct-to-consumer health-care delivery. Some expect that by the time the FAA pilot ends in November 2020, Mr Bezos will finally have his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 19:40:22 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“He’ll use these threats with other countries”—Donald Trump’s tariffs]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/06/10/hell-use-these-threats-with-other-countries-donald-trumps-tariffs]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190615_amm501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T11:26:43Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE end, President &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/09/mexico-rejoices-after-averting-donald-trumps-tariffs-threat&quot;&gt;tariff threat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; did what he had hoped: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/06/mexico-has-little-choice-but-to-placate-donald-trump&quot;&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; has pledged to tighten immigration flows&lt;/strong&gt;.

Founded in 1916 to train colonial administrators, military officers and the odd spy, the university came to be home to scholars with knowledge of the most obscure corners of the globe, as well as experts on rising countries like China and India. Its academics have been killed by the Khmer Rouge, composed the Swazi national anthem and written sweeping histories of the Meji restoration. In the words of a former director, “They must have formed the single biggest bunch of eccentrics in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today 4,345 students from more than 130 countries study courses varying from global pop music to accounting and finance. Since the 1960s the erstwhile colonial training centre has been a hub of radical politics (a recent campaign by students sought to “decolonise our minds” by changing the curriculum). It also represents a type of university—small, specialist and focused on languages—that has struggled in recent years. Since 2016 undergraduate admissions have fallen by 37%. In a warning seen by &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, the school’s director wrote at the end of last year that without action SOAS would “exhaust [its] cash reserves” in another two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not that the university is frozen in time. Over the past two decades there has been growth in the number of students taking degrees in social sciences and law, which have the advantage of being cheap to teach, and can thus subsidise niche language courses. Nevertheless, while uptake of languages like Japanese, Chinese and Arabic has risen, some smaller ones have fallen by the wayside. As Ian Brown, a SOAS expert on South-East Asia, notes in his history of the school, there are no longer teaching posts in Bengali, Punjabi or Tamil, and social scientists do not need to master a non-Western language, as was once expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main problem is that SOAS has struggled in a more competitive environment. The old system of state grants helped support universities that did a lot of language teaching. Nowadays most of their funding comes from tuition fees, and since 2015 universities have been free to recruit as many students as they want. In the words of an internal SOAS memo, rival high-ranking institutions “went growth-mad”, with King’s College and Queen Mary University London hoovering up students. SOAS initially responded by lowering its admission standards, to attract more applicants. It has since changed tack, raising its bar in order to maintain its position in league tables. Insiders say the school has been slow to tap donors to make up the shortfall. “It’s not a terribly capitalist institution,” is the verdict of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university promises measures to turn things around, including investments in the estate, better teaching and more overseas education. It says that applications for next year are looking perkier. Yet after last year’s disastrous admissions cycle, an extra £2.6m ($3.3m) had to be cut from academic staffing costs by 2021-22, on top of planned cuts of £3.4m since 2017-18. If things don’t improve, SOAS may have to lay on fewer courses, or perhaps even be absorbed by another institution. “There’s no way of teaching languages like Burmese or Zulu profitably,” accepts Justin Watkins, a linguistics professor at the university. But if the school goes, “something will have been lost that will be very hard to reacquire.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:41:20 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joan As Police Woman is one of the 21st century’s best musicians]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/06/10/joan-as-police-woman-is-one-of-the-21st-centurys-best-musicians]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190615_BKP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T17:01:05Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HISTORY IS not always kind to the overblown, nor does it always reward the deserving. Peter Frampton, for instance, was heard everywhere in his heyday, and the Velvet Underground scarcely listened to in theirs—now it is the other way around. Predicting who will slip from cultural memory and who will be enshrined in it is a fool��s errand, but if justice prevails the reputation of Joan Wasser, one of the outstanding musical artists of the 21st century, will surpass that of many of her more famous contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not that Ms Wasser labours in obscurity. Recording and performing under the stage name of Joan As Police Woman, she has built a substantial career for herself and commands a devoted following. But she lives in the wrong era to be a hitmaker. She might have flourished in the early 1970s, alongside other artists who bridge the gap between the singer-songwriter mode and soul music, such as Carole King, Laura Nyro and Phoebe Snow. Then again, her music draws on influences that would have then been unavailable to her, including Sonic Youth, an avant-punk outfit (whose song “Sacred Trickster” she has covered), and the experimental orchestral pop of Antony and the Johnsons, the band in which she got her break as a violinist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group provided her with a creative outlet and a crucial step towards artistic independence. Her life up to that point had been eventful: adopted as an infant (a fact she has intimated is relevant to her impulse to perform), she went on to study classical music and took that training into a series of punk bands. She was three years into a relationship with Jeff Buckley, an acclaimed singer, when he died by accidental drowning in 1997—the tragedy devastated her, and its aftershocks would be felt in her music for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Joanthology”, a comprehensive new 43-song collection, tracks Ms Wasser’s work from her self-titled debut EP in 2004 to her seventh album, “Damned Devotion”, released last year. “Joan As Police Woman” was self-released, and it wasn’t until 2006—after signing with Reveal, a British label—that she found an audience that had thus far eluded her at home in America. “Real Life”, her debut LP, echoed Memphis soul (in particular, her beloved Al Green), the Pretenders, Siouxsie Sioux, Nina Simone and the Joni Mitchell of “The Hissing of Summer Lawns” and “Hejira”. It became a critical hit. Ms Wasser, who had not set out to be a singer, proved to be blessed with a warm mezzo-soprano and her songs lost nothing in feeling by being highly sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Real Life” and its successor “To Survive” (2008) were beguiling records that dealt obliquely with Ms Wasser’s painful past and her coming to terms with it, as hinted by their titles. It was on her third album of original songs, “The Deep Field” (2011), that she truly came of age as an artist. Where the first two were elegant, rich and soulful, the third was an expression of wild ambition. It combined the sound and the spirit of jazz and psychedelic soul with assured musicianship. “The Deep Field” was a lovely, immersive record, with the air of subtle rapture that has since characterised so much of Ms Wasser’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As “Joanthology” illustrates, Ms Wasser is also unafraid to be abrasive—even, at times, confrontational. Those punk years were not wasted. In covering Prince and Public Enemy, she is anything but gimmicky; rather, she rebuilds their songs from the ground up. She takes them on with evident respect but neither fear nor false modesty. Her body of work suggests she has earned the right to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:40:16 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China seems deaf to mass protests in Hong Kong over extradition]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/10/china-seems-deaf-to-mass-protests-in-hong-kong-over-extradition]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_asp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT IS COMMONLY said in Hong Kong that many of its 7m people have been suffering from “protest fatigue” since the failure of weeks of demonstrations and sit-ins in 2014 to persuade the government to grant the Chinese territory greater democracy. In the past week there has been clear evidence that this diagnosis is wrong. First, on June 4th, came the biggest turnout in years for the territory’s annual candle-lit vigil commemorating the crushing of the Tiananmen Square unrest thirty years ago. About 180,000 people took part, organisers said. Then, on June 9th, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in protest against a proposed law that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party. It may have been the biggest demonstration since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition to the extradition bill has been widespread, even drawing in businesspeople who normally support the government. Several senior judges have expressed concern about it. On June 6th hundreds of lawyers staged a rare protest against the legislation. Among those who took part in the massive protest three days later were political parties, student groups and church congregations. Many demonstrators wore white, a symbol of mourning. Some wore yellow, the colour adopted by the protesters in 2014. For hours they filled the streets of central Hong Kong, shouting slogans against the “evil law” and calling on the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, to step down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration was largely peaceful. But at 11pm the government issued a statement saying it would press ahead with its plans for getting the bill adopted by the Legislative Council, known as Legco (it is hoping that it will be passed before legislators begin their summer vacation in July). Seemingly in response, some of the hundreds of protesters who had gathered outside the government’s headquarters tried to force their way in. Police armed with pepper spray and batons moved in to disperse them. Several people were injured, including three police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governments in Hong Kong and Beijing say the bill will close a “loophole” which makes it impossible to send suspects to “other parts of China”. But many people fear the legislation could be abused. Even though the proposed law would not apply to people accused of political crimes, critics of the bill say China’s judiciary could secure the extradition of such people by charging them with other offences. They also say that China’s courts are so prone to political interference, and so opaque, that no suspect can be guaranteed a fair trial. The bill would apply to anyone physically in Hong Kong, including a banker on a business trip or a journalist in transit through the airport. That worries many people beyond Hong Kong itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government says that it has been taking account of such criticisms. It has modified the bill to reduce the number of economic crimes to which it would apply, and to make it cover only more severe offences. It has clarified that it would not consider extradition requests from China’s provincial courts. They would need to be made by the country’s supreme court. Officials in Hong Kong say the bill would comply with Hong Kong’s human-rights standards. Some Hong Kongers are persuaded by this. A group supporting the bill says it has gathered more than 800,000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the demonstration, Mrs Lam denied that she was introducing the legislation at the request of the central government. Officials in Hong Kong say there is a practical reason for getting it passed now. Under the current law, a Hong Kong man who stands accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan cannot be sent back there for trial. But Taiwan says it will not ask for the suspect’s extradition under the new law. That is because the bill refers to Taiwan as part of China’s territory, which the island does not accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the protest will put Mrs Lam under considerable political pressure. In 2003 about half a million people took to the streets to protests against an anti-subversion bill which they feared would be used to crush dissent. The protest resulted in the shelving of the legislation and the eventual resignation of the then chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa. In 2014 student-led protests led to the watering down of a plan to introduce a curriculum that would whitewash the Communist Party’s record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all pressure yields results. The weeks-long protests and sit-ins later that year, known as the “Umbrella Movement”, resulted in no concessions. After the demonstration on June 9th Mrs Lam repeated her support for the bill. She is also likely to take her cue from officials in Beijing, who have expressed strong support for the legislation. In response to the demonstration, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the central government would continue to “firmly support” the administration in Hong Kong, and warned against “outside interference”. &lt;em&gt;China Daily&lt;/em&gt;, a state-owned newspaper, accused “foreign forces” of aiming to “hurt China by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong.” Such statements do not suggest that the mood in Beijing is conciliatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:40:15 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kazakhstan’s choreographed election goes off script]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/06/10/kazakhstans-choreographed-election-goes-off-script]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_eup501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HAPPY HOLIDAY!” a pie seller in Kazakh national dress told voters leaving a polling station in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s financial capital. A short stroll away in a leafy park, police were ruining the festive mood. Masked security forces carried away prostrate protesters and hurled them into police vans. They were breaking up a peaceful demonstration by a few hundred dissenters who had gathered to demand change, even as the man who was certain to be elected president promised them continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassym-Jomart Tokayev won a landslide in the election, which was called following the recent resignation of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the iron-fisted leader who had ruled for three decades. Kazakhstan has never held a vote deemed free and fair by credible international observers. This time monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted that the election showed “scant respect for democratic standards”. Despite the presence this time of a candidate critical of the regime, the current election seems only cosmetically different. Mr Tokayev stormed in with 71% of the vote, admittedly far below Mr Nazarbayev’s last triumph, at 98%. Mr Tokayev’s closest rival, Amirzhan Kosanov, trailed on 16%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Kosanov’s presence is a departure from tradition: Mr Nazarbayev used to run against supporters of the regime who took part simply to provide a semblance of competition. This is the first presidential election in 14 years to feature a challenger with a record of opposition, although other critics of the regime worry that he, too, will just provide a democratic veneer. How could it be otherwise in a country that has no formal opposition parties, in which the media and civil society are muzzled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apparent rubber-stamping of Mr Tokayev (he is currently interim president) in this choreographed election is part of an experiment that Mr Nazarbayev has dreamt up for his country, untested elsewhere in the post-Soviet world. He seems to be attempting to install a chosen successor while still alive to secure his legacy, although some speculate that Mr Tokayev is just a seat-warmer in an even more elaborate scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumours are rife that Mr Nazarbayev wants his daughter, Dariga Nazarbayeva, who presides over the Senate, to become president eventually. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s 78-year-old founding father is micromanaging the transition to a president cast in his own image. Mr Tokayev, 66, is a Soviet-era apparatchik who became foreign minister and prime minister after Kazakhstan became independent. His diplomatic skills will help him juggle relations with Kazakhstan’s mighty neighbours, Russia and China, as well as the West--a trick Mr Nazarbayev managed with great dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is at home that Mr Tokayev will face his greatest challenges. Mr Nazarbayev’s resignation has galvanised some of Kazakhstan’s 18m citizens—especially people under 29, who have only ever known Mr Nazarbayev as leader and now make up over half the population—to challenge the regime’s zero-tolerance attitude towards dissent. The authorities in Nur-Sultan, the capital recently renamed after Mr Nazarbayev, have responded by arresting peaceful protesters, rounding up 500 on election day in Nur-Sultan and Almaty and another 100 or so in Almaty on June 10th after results were released. Three mothers are under house arrest after participating in a demonstration in May. The regime has jailed people for demanding a fair election, and briefly detained a man who displayed a blank piece of paper, with no overt criticism of the regime, to test the limits of peaceful expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such repression has backfired. It has become the catalyst for a protest movement rallying around a phrase from a century-old poem urging Kazakhs to shake off the shackles of Russian colonial rule: “I’ve woken up.” Inventive videos have gone viral. Offline, activists have formed a new movement, “Oyan, Qazaqstan” (Wake Up, Kazakhstan). Critics deride them as out-of-touch hipsters, but their nine-point platform for political reforms, including the abolition of the executive presidency, is clear and straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Tokayev is not on record as having studied it. His capacity to conduct reforms is hamstrung by the looming presence of Mr Nazarbayev, who will not want to see the system he fashioned dismantled, or even tinkered with. Despite the country’s oil wealth many complain of unemployment, low wages, corruption, and a lack of access to housing, health care and education. Before the election, Mr Tokayev took to Twitter to promise “political modernisation” and reforms to tackle festering socio-economic grievances. “Old problems—new solutions,” he tweeted brightly. Kassymkhan Kapparov, a respected economist and pro-democracy activist, riposted tartly: “Old problems—old people who created them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 23:01:30 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
