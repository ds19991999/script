Taxpayers in the top tenth of the distribution would get £2,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Johnson’s proposal is particularly good for wealthy retirees, who pay income tax but not payroll taxes.Most Britons would gain little (unless, as some contenders claim, their tax cuts spark a widespread economic boom).

Founded in 1916 to train colonial administrators, military officers and the odd spy, the university came to be home to scholars with knowledge of the most obscure corners of the globe, as well as experts on rising countries like China and India. Its academics have been killed by the Khmer Rouge, composed the Swazi national anthem and written sweeping histories of the Meji restoration. In the words of a former director, “They must have formed the single biggest bunch of eccentrics in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today 4,345 students from more than 130 countries study courses varying from global pop music to accounting and finance. Since the 1960s the erstwhile colonial training centre has been a hub of radical politics (a recent campaign by students sought to “decolonise our minds” by changing the curriculum). It also represents a type of university—small, specialist and focused on languages—that has struggled in recent years. Since 2016 undergraduate admissions have fallen by 37%. In a warning seen by &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, the school’s director wrote at the end of last year that without action SOAS would “exhaust [its] cash reserves” in another two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not that the university is frozen in time. Over the past two decades there has been growth in the number of students taking degrees in social sciences and law, which have the advantage of being cheap to teach, and can thus subsidise niche language courses. Nevertheless, while uptake of languages like Japanese, Chinese and Arabic has risen, some smaller ones have fallen by the wayside. As Ian Brown, a SOAS expert on South-East Asia, notes in his history of the school, there are no longer teaching posts in Bengali, Punjabi or Tamil, and social scientists do not need to master a non-Western language, as was once expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main problem is that SOAS has struggled in a more competitive environment. The old system of state grants helped support universities that did a lot of language teaching. Nowadays most of their funding comes from tuition fees, and since 2015 universities have been free to recruit as many students as they want. In the words of an internal SOAS memo, rival high-ranking institutions “went growth-mad”, with King’s College and Queen Mary University London hoovering up students. SOAS initially responded by lowering its admission standards, to attract more applicants. It has since changed tack, raising its bar in order to maintain its position in league tables. Insiders say the school has been slow to tap donors to make up the shortfall. “It’s not a terribly capitalist institution,” is the verdict of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university promises measures to turn things around, including investments in the estate, better teaching and more overseas education. It says that applications for next year are looking perkier. Yet after last year’s disastrous admissions cycle, an extra £2.6m ($3.3m) had to be cut from academic staffing costs by 2021-22, on top of planned cuts of £3.4m since 2017-18. If things don’t improve, SOAS may have to lay on fewer courses, or perhaps even be absorbed by another institution. “There’s no way of teaching languages like Burmese or Zulu profitably,” accepts Justin Watkins, a linguistics professor at the university. But if the school goes, “something will have been lost that will be very hard to reacquire.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:41:20 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joan As Police Woman is one of the 21st century’s best musicians]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/06/10/joan-as-police-woman-is-one-of-the-21st-centurys-best-musicians]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190615_BKP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T17:01:05Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HISTORY IS not always kind to the overblown, nor does it always reward the deserving. Peter Frampton, for instance, was heard everywhere in his heyday, and the Velvet Underground scarcely listened to in theirs—now it is the other way around. Predicting who will slip from cultural memory and who will be enshrined in it is a fool��s errand, but if justice prevails the reputation of Joan Wasser, one of the outstanding musical artists of the 21st century, will surpass that of many of her more famous contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not that Ms Wasser labours in obscurity. Recording and performing under the stage name of Joan As Police Woman, she has built a substantial career for herself and commands a devoted following. But she lives in the wrong era to be a hitmaker. She might have flourished in the early 1970s, alongside other artists who bridge the gap between the singer-songwriter mode and soul music, such as Carole King, Laura Nyro and Phoebe Snow. Then again, her music draws on influences that would have then been unavailable to her, including Sonic Youth, an avant-punk outfit (whose song “Sacred Trickster” she has covered), and the experimental orchestral pop of Antony and the Johnsons, the band in which she got her break as a violinist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group provided her with a creative outlet and a crucial step towards artistic independence. Her life up to that point had been eventful: adopted as an infant (a fact she has intimated is relevant to her impulse to perform), she went on to study classical music and took that training into a series of punk bands. She was three years into a relationship with Jeff Buckley, an acclaimed singer, when he died by accidental drowning in 1997—the tragedy devastated her, and its aftershocks would be felt in her music for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Joanthology”, a comprehensive new 43-song collection, tracks Ms Wasser’s work from her self-titled debut EP in 2004 to her seventh album, “Damned Devotion”, released last year. “Joan As Police Woman” was self-released, and it wasn’t until 2006—after signing with Reveal, a British label—that she found an audience that had thus far eluded her at home in America. “Real Life”, her debut LP, echoed Memphis soul (in particular, her beloved Al Green), the Pretenders, Siouxsie Sioux, Nina Simone and the Joni Mitchell of “The Hissing of Summer Lawns” and “Hejira”. It became a critical hit. Ms Wasser, who had not set out to be a singer, proved to be blessed with a warm mezzo-soprano and her songs lost nothing in feeling by being highly sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Real Life” and its successor “To Survive” (2008) were beguiling records that dealt obliquely with Ms Wasser’s painful past and her coming to terms with it, as hinted by their titles. It was on her third album of original songs, “The Deep Field” (2011), that she truly came of age as an artist. Where the first two were elegant, rich and soulful, the third was an expression of wild ambition. It combined the sound and the spirit of jazz and psychedelic soul with assured musicianship. “The Deep Field” was a lovely, immersive record, with the air of subtle rapture that has since characterised so much of Ms Wasser’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As “Joanthology” illustrates, Ms Wasser is also unafraid to be abrasive—even, at times, confrontational. Those punk years were not wasted. In covering Prince and Public Enemy, she is anything but gimmicky; rather, she rebuilds their songs from the ground up. She takes them on with evident respect but neither fear nor false modesty. Her body of work suggests she has earned the right to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:40:16 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China seems deaf to mass protests in Hong Kong over extradition]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/10/china-seems-deaf-to-mass-protests-in-hong-kong-over-extradition]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_asp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT IS COMMONLY said in Hong Kong that many of its 7m people have been suffering from “protest fatigue” since the failure of weeks of demonstrations and sit-ins in 2014 to persuade the government to grant the Chinese territory greater democracy. In the past week there has been clear evidence that this diagnosis is wrong. First, on June 4th, came the biggest turnout in years for the territory’s annual candle-lit vigil commemorating the crushing of the Tiananmen Square unrest thirty years ago. About 180,000 people took part, organisers said. Then, on June 9th, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in protest against a proposed law that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party. It may have been the biggest demonstration since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition to the extradition bill has been widespread, even drawing in businesspeople who normally support the government. Several senior judges have expressed concern about it. On June 6th hundreds of lawyers staged a rare protest against the legislation. Among those who took part in the massive protest three days later were political parties, student groups and church congregations. Many demonstrators wore white, a symbol of mourning. Some wore yellow, the colour adopted by the protesters in 2014. For hours they filled the streets of central Hong Kong, shouting slogans against the “evil law” and calling on the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, to step down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration was largely peaceful. But at 11pm the government issued a statement saying it would press ahead with its plans for getting the bill adopted by the Legislative Council, known as Legco (it is hoping that it will be passed before legislators begin their summer vacation in July). Seemingly in response, some of the hundreds of protesters who had gathered outside the government’s headquarters tried to force their way in. Police armed with pepper spray and batons moved in to disperse them. Several people were injured, including three police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governments in Hong Kong and Beijing say the bill will close a “loophole” which makes it impossible to send suspects to “other parts of China”. But many people fear the legislation could be abused. Even though the proposed law would not apply to people accused of political crimes, critics of the bill say China’s judiciary could secure the extradition of such people by charging them with other offences. They also say that China’s courts are so prone to political interference, and so opaque, that no suspect can be guaranteed a fair trial. The bill would apply to anyone physically in Hong Kong, including a banker on a business trip or a journalist in transit through the airport. That worries many people beyond Hong Kong itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government says that it has been taking account of such criticisms. It has modified the bill to reduce the number of economic crimes to which it would apply, and to make it cover only more severe offences. It has clarified that it would not consider extradition requests from China’s provincial courts. They would need to be made by the country’s supreme court. Officials in Hong Kong say the bill would comply with Hong Kong’s human-rights standards. Some Hong Kongers are persuaded by this. A group supporting the bill says it has gathered more than 800,000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the demonstration, Mrs Lam denied that she was introducing the legislation at the request of the central government. Officials in Hong Kong say there is a practical reason for getting it passed now. Under the current law, a Hong Kong man who stands accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan cannot be sent back there for trial. But Taiwan says it will not ask for the suspect’s extradition under the new law. That is because the bill refers to Taiwan as part of China’s territory, which the island does not accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the protest will put Mrs Lam under considerable political pressure. In 2003 about half a million people took to the streets to protests against an anti-subversion bill which they feared would be used to crush dissent. The protest resulted in the shelving of the legislation and the eventual resignation of the then chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa. In 2014 student-led protests led to the watering down of a plan to introduce a curriculum that would whitewash the Communist Party’s record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all pressure yields results. The weeks-long protests and sit-ins later that year, known as the “Umbrella Movement”, resulted in no concessions. After the demonstration on June 9th Mrs Lam repeated her support for the bill. She is also likely to take her cue from officials in Beijing, who have expressed strong support for the legislation. In response to the demonstration, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the central government would continue to “firmly support” the administration in Hong Kong, and warned against “outside interference”. &lt;em&gt;China Daily&lt;/em&gt;, a state-owned newspaper, accused “foreign forces” of aiming to “hurt China by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong.” Such statements do not suggest that the mood in Beijing is conciliatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:40:15 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kazakhstan’s choreographed election goes off script]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/06/10/kazakhstans-choreographed-election-goes-off-script]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_eup501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HAPPY HOLIDAY!” a pie seller in Kazakh national dress told voters leaving a polling station in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s financial capital. A short stroll away in a leafy park, police were ruining the festive mood. Masked security forces carried away prostrate protesters and hurled them into police vans. They were breaking up a peaceful demonstration by a few hundred dissenters who had gathered to demand change, even as the man who was certain to be elected president promised them continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassym-Jomart Tokayev won a landslide in the election, which was called following the recent resignation of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the iron-fisted leader who had ruled for three decades. Kazakhstan has never held a vote deemed free and fair by credible international observers. This time monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted that the election showed “scant respect for democratic standards”. Despite the presence this time of a candidate critical of the regime, the current election seems only cosmetically different. Mr Tokayev stormed in with 71% of the vote, admittedly far below Mr Nazarbayev’s last triumph, at 98%. Mr Tokayev’s closest rival, Amirzhan Kosanov, trailed on 16%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Kosanov’s presence is a departure from tradition: Mr Nazarbayev used to run against supporters of the regime who took part simply to provide a semblance of competition. This is the first presidential election in 14 years to feature a challenger with a record of opposition, although other critics of the regime worry that he, too, will just provide a democratic veneer. How could it be otherwise in a country that has no formal opposition parties, in which the media and civil society are muzzled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apparent rubber-stamping of Mr Tokayev (he is currently interim president) in this choreographed election is part of an experiment that Mr Nazarbayev has dreamt up for his country, untested elsewhere in the post-Soviet world. He seems to be attempting to install a chosen successor while still alive to secure his legacy, although some speculate that Mr Tokayev is just a seat-warmer in an even more elaborate scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumours are rife that Mr Nazarbayev wants his daughter, Dariga Nazarbayeva, who presides over the Senate, to become president eventually. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s 78-year-old founding father is micromanaging the transition to a president cast in his own image. Mr Tokayev, 66, is a Soviet-era apparatchik who became foreign minister and prime minister after Kazakhstan became independent. His diplomatic skills will help him juggle relations with Kazakhstan’s mighty neighbours, Russia and China, as well as the West--a trick Mr Nazarbayev managed with great dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is at home that Mr Tokayev will face his greatest challenges. Mr Nazarbayev’s resignation has galvanised some of Kazakhstan’s 18m citizens—especially people under 29, who have only ever known Mr Nazarbayev as leader and now make up over half the population—to challenge the regime’s zero-tolerance attitude towards dissent. The authorities in Nur-Sultan, the capital recently renamed after Mr Nazarbayev, have responded by arresting peaceful protesters, rounding up 500 on election day in Nur-Sultan and Almaty and another 100 or so in Almaty on June 10th after results were released. Three mothers are under house arrest after participating in a demonstration in May. The regime has jailed people for demanding a fair election, and briefly detained a man who displayed a blank piece of paper, with no overt criticism of the regime, to test the limits of peaceful expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such repression has backfired. It has become the catalyst for a protest movement rallying around a phrase from a century-old poem urging Kazakhs to shake off the shackles of Russian colonial rule: “I’ve woken up.” Inventive videos have gone viral. Offline, activists have formed a new movement, “Oyan, Qazaqstan” (Wake Up, Kazakhstan). Critics deride them as out-of-touch hipsters, but their nine-point platform for political reforms, including the abolition of the executive presidency, is clear and straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Tokayev is not on record as having studied it. His capacity to conduct reforms is hamstrung by the looming presence of Mr Nazarbayev, who will not want to see the system he fashioned dismantled, or even tinkered with. Despite the country’s oil wealth many complain of unemployment, low wages, corruption, and a lack of access to housing, health care and education. Before the election, Mr Tokayev took to Twitter to promise “political modernisation” and reforms to tackle festering socio-economic grievances. “Old problems—new solutions,” he tweeted brightly. Kassymkhan Kapparov, a respected economist and pro-democracy activist, riposted tartly: “Old problems—old people who created them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 23:01:30 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The race to become Britain’s next PM]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/10/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm]]></link><description>&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HERESA MAY&lt;/small&gt; stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7th.

The result of their vote will be announced before Parliament rises for summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-infographic-&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betfair Exchange, a gambling website, has been tracking punters’ predictions on the next Tory leader.

Growth faltered, the currency slumped and foreign donors stopped contributing to the budget. The results have been “devastating”, says Denise Namburete, a civil-society activist, describing health centres that have gone two years without medicines. American prosecutors are pursuing eight people involved in the scandal, including three foreign bankers and a former finance minister, on charges of money-laundering and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mozambique case may be unusual. Or it may not. New kinds of lending are so opaque that even the IMF is scratching its head about how much governments truly owe. In some places the mystery is loans from China and other emerging lenders. In others it is advance payments from oil traders, liabilities from public-private partnerships or hidden loans from commercial banks. The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a group of banks and financial institutions, has responded to mounting concern by drafting principles on debt transparency. Finance ministers of G20 countries endorsed them at a summit in Fukuoka, Japan, on June 8th-9th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IIF principles are voluntary and would apply only to lending from the private sector, not from states. Lenders would disclose any loans they make to low-income governments or state firms within 60-120 days of funds being released. Details would include the purpose of the loan, its structure and a range within which the interest rate falls. The data would be kept in a repository at an international institution, perhaps the IMF or World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they are so minded, the G20 countries could use their voting power at the IMF to insist it hosts the data. Their endorsement will also have weight with the private sector at large, says Sonja Gibbs of the IIF. Although lenders benefit from knowing more about government debts, some are reluctant to share information they consider commercially sensitive. They will need to be pressed to participate. “It will be a name and shame game,” says Mark Plant of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank. “That sometimes works, it sometimes doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to give the scheme bite? One proposal is that sovereign-loan contracts that are not publicly disclosed within 30 days of signature should be unenforceable in court. Most international loans are made under New York or English law—as Mozambique’s dodgy deals were—so tweaking the rules in those two jurisdictions would be a good start. Case law and legal institutions are so well established that business would be unlikely to shift elsewhere, argues Tim Jones of Jubilee Debt Campaign, the British charity behind the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 51 members of parliament have written to the British chancellor in support of Jubilee’s proposal, among them former secretaries of state for international development from the Labour and Conservative parties. On June 5th the opposition Labour party said it would implement the idea if it wins power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal changes are not yet on the G20’s agenda. But rising debt levels are fuelling a sense of urgency. The IMF reckons that 44% of low-income countries are now in debt distress or at high risk of it—even without more nasty surprises. The average developing country’s external-debt payments have risen from 6.6% of government revenue in 2010 to 12.2% in 2018, calculates Jubilee. When politicians borrow clandestinely, it is their people who foot the bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 19:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico rejoices after averting Donald Trump’s tariffs threat]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/09/mexico-rejoices-after-averting-donald-trumps-tariffs-threat]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_blp902.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-09T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 9th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALL IT a victory. Compared with crippling tariffs on all exports to the United States that President Donald Trump had threatened to impose, starting at 5% on June 10th and escalating to 25%, just about any deal was going to look good for Mexico. &lt;br/&gt;News of an accord reached by Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, to have the tariffs suspended indefinitely caused relief and celebration across the country—even before its contents became clear. “Ebrard deactivates Trump,” screeched the front page of El Heraldo, a newspaper, the morning after the deal on June 7th. “Mexico wins,” ran another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A saga that had threatened to hobble the still-young presidency of Andrés Manuel López Obrador became instead a crisis averted. Mexico’s president announced that a rally he had planned in central Tijuana in “defence of national dignity” would now become a celebration of Mexico’s success at the negotiating table. On June 8th governors, bishops and unionists joined the president on the stage at a traffic intersection as locals climbed atop bus stops and taco stands to glimpse the festivities. “To President Donald Trump I raise not a closed fist, but an open and honest hand,” said Mr López Obrador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he is not the only president doing a victory lap. Mr Trump wants to turn Mexico into the wall that he promised but has so far failed to build. He tweeted his satisfaction that Mexico would take “strong measures” towards halting the inflow of Central American migrants. In May some 144,000 people tried to cross the southern border of the United States, double the number in February. Almost all of them had travelled through Mexico rather than from it. Mr Trump’s defenders argue that using tariffs as a threat to force Mexico to get tough on migration was a masterstroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accord includes the expansion of “Remain In Mexico”—a fledgling scheme that forces migrants to wait in Mexico while their claims for asylum in the United States are processed— from a few checkpoints to the entire American-Mexican border. From June 10th Mexico will also deploy 6,000 troops of its newly created national guard to two states—Chiapas, bordering Guatemala, and Oaxaca, which has a narrow isthmus—to stop migrants and people-smugglers. That will dent the number of migrants reaching the United States, though flows across the US-Mexico border tend to dip anyway in the scorching months of June and July. The sides did not set specific reduction targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal allows the United States to demand more from Mexico within 90 days if numbers do not fall as much as the Trump administration would like. But it is less impressive than Mr Trump claims. “Remain In Mexico” was already set for expansion. Mexican officials describe the deployment of the national guard as an “acceleration” of what they were planning to do anyway. Mr Trump tweeted that Mexico had agreed to “immediately buy large quantities of agricultural product from our great patriot farmers”. Mr Ebrard clarified that, if spared Mr Trump’s recession-inducing tariffs, Mexico would be in a better position to buy many different things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico has toed a fine line in negotiations. Mr Lopez López Obrador initially responded to Mr Trump’s threat by penning an affectionate letter—a strategy for presidential seduction borrowed from Kim Jong Un. Mexico froze two-dozen bank accounts linked to people-smuggling operations and locked up two activists involved in helping so-called migrant caravans travel through Mexico. But it also rebuffed other requests, particularly pressure to accept “safe third country” status, which would, in effect, allow the United States to reject the asylum application of anyone who set foot in Mexico beforehand, and send back to Mexico those who make it into the United States. Mexicans officials say they also had to explain to their counterparts that their border with Guatemala, porous and often ignored by locals, could be strengthened but not entirely sealed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The peso climbed upon news of the deal, but not to the level it was before Mr Trump first unsheathed his tariffs threat. That suggests that markets have priced in the chance of a return to conflict. It also suggests that investors do not believe that the USMCA, Mr Trump’s recently struck revamp of the NAFTA trade pact, provides the kind of economic certainty that free-trade deals are supposed to. From North America to North Korea, Mr Trump has made a habit of threatening to abandon his own deals even after reaching them through brinkmanship. Mexican negotiators know that Mr Trump can enrapture his fans and distract his enemies by chucking bombs at Mexico, and has every reason to do so again before his bid for re-election in 2020. “It’s like Alcoholics Anonymous, we live one day at a time,” says one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of Mr López Obrador critics, it is he, not Mr Trump, who has performed a humiliating climbdown. Mr López Obrado entered office promising to end the mass deportations of Central Americans carried out by past Mexican presidents. Indeed, the drop in the number of migrants detained during his first months in office, which American officials blame for the rise in illegal crossings, drew Mr Trump’s ire. Despite rhetoric about respecting migrants’ rights, Mexican officials concede that deportations are all but certain to rocket. &lt;br/&gt;Tijuana thus made for a bittersweet location for Mr López Obrador’s victory rally. The city is not just the cradle of Mexican-American integration, or a state that the president’s party swept in state elections on June 2nd. It is also the final destination for many of the migrants on their way to America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those thronging Tijuana were two strolling visitors who chanced upon the president’s speech. Valerio Doctor, a Haitian migrant, had been in Tijuana for 15 days, following a three-month trip mostly by bus from Ecuador (many migrants arrive in Mexico from afar via Ecuador or Chile, the nearest countries with generous visa-free travel rules). In Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, he had five children and no work. So with his friend he left to seek a path to prosperity elsewhere. In a crowd Mr Doctor watches Mr López Obrador vow to fortify the very border he and his friend had just crossed. Until that moment, the pair knew nothing of the deal. Mr Doctor still hopes to cross to the United States or, if it will not have him, to stay in Mexico. How the deal struck with so much fanfare and consequence 24 hours earlier will affect him is still unclear. The lot of poor migrants is often hard and uncertain. For those who try to follow Mr Doctor, it is likely to be harder and more uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 04:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
