It would be mistaken to call this a movement; it was more an attitude. Its standard-bearers were The Band, whose mix of ramshackle rock’n’roll and old-timey aesthetics would form the basis of the Americana genre. Folk and country music were its principal sources, but such diverse figures as Van Dyke Parks, Harry Nilsson and Randy Newman would draw on more metropolitan sounds, including ragtime, vaudeville, musicals and American classical, as well as those of the American Gulf coast and the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key figure is often left out of this story. The omission might seem odd, given that he was a member of one of the decade’s most successful bands: the Monkees, assembled by television producers for the comedy show of the same name. It made no odds that Michael Nesmith, like fellow Monkee Peter Tork (who died in February), was a product of the folk-music scene. His five-year tenure as a teen idol in a “manufactured” pop group (a dismissive phrase which overlooks how all groups are manufactured in one way or another, as well as Mr Nesmith’s revolt against that interference) would define him in the mind of the public, while his subsequent recording career would go overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new box set, “Songs”, contains the first 11 of Mr Nesmith’s 14 (thus far) solo albums, along with a compilation from 1989. It offers an opportunity to reassess his body of work, and discover why he is so influential among musicians—acts as varied as the Breeders, the Jayhawks, Susanna Hoffs and Run-DMC have covered his songs—and cherished by a small but ardent following which at last has easy access to the bulk of his catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The set divides neatly into two parts. The first six discs cover a creative flurry between 1970, when Mr Nesmith took a hefty financial hit to be released from his Monkees contract, and 1973. These are the country-rock albums he recorded with his short-lived backing group, the First National Band, its successor of even briefer tenure, the Second National Band, and finally as the sole credited artist (now going by Michael, to distinguish him from the woolly-hatted television character “Mike”). The first of these albums, “Magnetic South”, would yield the only top-40 single of his solo career, “Joanne”—a reversal of fortune for the former member of an act which had scored five top-three singles and four number-one albums in a two-year period. Mr Nesmith’s fifth solo LP, in 1972, would bear the sardonic title “The Hits Just Keep On Coming”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not that Mr Nesmith wished to be obscure or uncommercial, and there was nothing about his solo material that determined it should be. His composition “Different Drum” had five years before been a substantial hit for Linda Ronstadt’s group, the Stone Poneys, whose version stands as a minor classic. It is Mr Nesmith’s most celebrated song, and it says a great deal that many who enjoy it will have no idea he wrote it. His own, folksy take—strikingly different from the chiming, driving Stone Poneys number—underlines his distinctive qualities as a writer and performer: his way with a melody, his phrasing of concise narrative detail and his capacity to be at once wry and rueful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing and circumstance condemned those first six records to obscurity. Mr Nesmith signed to Nashville’s leading label, RCA, but the burgeoning hip country-rock scene—for which his music would have been a natural fit—was suspicious at best of the ex-bubblegum pop star. Monkees fans, meanwhile, had already abandoned that group as it strove for artistic independence; they would have been bewildered by what they heard, if they heard it at all. Today, those albums make up a treasure trove, liable to delight the first-time listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Nesmith became notably less prolific as other interests intervened: it took him two decades to issue as much music as he did in those first three years. The video clip he made for “Rio”, one of his better-known songs, led him to devise a show called “PopClips” for Nickelodeon, a children’s cable channel. Acquired by TimeWarner, “PopClips” became the basis for MTV, the standalone channel that transformed music, and the music business, in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rio”, with its Latin lilt, demonstrated how Mr Nesmith’s palette expanded from the mid-1970s onwards, as he released music on his own Pacific Arts label. The second half of “Songs” shows him becoming ever more experimental, with such pieces as the soundtrack to a book (“The Prison”, 1975) and its chiefly instrumental companion album, “The Garden” (1994). His more overtly pop albums utilise the sounds of the Americas in a way that prefigures the work of David Byrne. Never compromising, never anything other than amiably inventive, never sounding—no matter what form he works in—like anyone other than himself, Mr Nesmith has lived up to the pseudonym he once used in the 1960s: Michael Blessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:06:15 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Can the law still do justice in America?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/12/can-the-law-still-do-justice-in-america]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_blp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-12T16:08:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 12th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANNE MCELVOY talks to Preet Bharara, a former federal attorney in New York, who successfully took on some of the biggest crimes in America involving corruption, organised crime and terrorism.

On April 6th they concluded regular-season play with a typically convincing 6-3 victory over the Boston Bruins, the second-best team in the NHL’s Eastern Conference. It was the Lightning’s 62nd win this season, matching the league record set by the Detroit Red Wings in 1995-96, a squad that featured seven future members of the Hall of Fame. Tampa Bay had never before accumulated more than 54 victories in a season, and no NHL franchise in the last decade had won more than 56 games in a single campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a team to win more than three-quarters of its 82-game regular season fixtures, almost everything has to go right. For Tampa Bay this season, it did. Steven Stamkos, the veteran centre and captain, justified his annual $9.5m salary by commanding the league’s best offence. Meanwhile Nikita Kucherov, a winger, led the NHL in points (goals plus assists) and matched the all-time record for assists from his position. Andrei Vasilevskiy, the goaltender, remained one of the top puck-stoppers in the league, backing up a stellar defence which was led by Victor Hedman. Best of all, the Lightning remained largely injury-free. They scored 103 more goals than they allowed, while the next-best team, the Calgary Flames, managed a differential of only 62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every season features a leader in the wins column, but the structure of the NHL limits the likelihood that a team would dominate to such a degree. The league’s hard salary cap, introduced after a protracted labour dispute that wiped out the 2004-05 season, ensures that no team can simply spend its way to glory. A modest payroll limit, tied to league-wide revenues and set at $79.5m in 2018-19, keeps most free-agent salaries within reach of small-market clubs. When Detroit recorded their 62-win season 23 years ago, their $28.5m payroll was more than double that of four other teams, including the Lightning, who were still floundering as a recent expansion franchise. This year, all but two NHL teams &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nhlnumbers.com/team-salaries&quot;&gt;spent at least $67m&lt;/a&gt;, within $11m of Tampa Bay’s $78m outlay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking home the Presidents’ Trophy, the silverware given to the NHL team with the best record in the regular season, requires that those limited millions are spent wisely. Tampa Bay’s roster includes only one of the 25 highest-paid players in the league, Mr Stamkos, whose paycheck was tied for 15th place. Yet according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.hockey-reference.com/about/point_shares.html&quot;&gt;Point Shares&lt;/a&gt; (PS), a metric that apportions a team’s results among its players, the Lightning’s lineup is studded with skaters who were worth just as much. Leading the pack is Mr Kucherov, a 25-year-old right winger earning $5.5m, who posted one of the best offensive performances of the decade. His 14.6 PS set him comfortably ahead of Connor McDavid, Edmonton’s 22-year-old superstar, whose 13.0 PS was exchanged for a $15m paycheck. Wringing 62 wins out of $78m also requires that some production should come at next to no cost, such as the 11.4 PS earned by Brayden Point, the Lightning’s 23-year-old second-line centre. As a third-year player yet to qualify for free agency, Mr Point handed his team an all-star level performance for $650,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the salary cap helps maintain regular-season parity, then the NHL playoff system has long served a similar purpose by preventing a runaway winner. To secure the Stanley Cup, the sport’s most coveted prize, a team must win four playoff rounds, each involving a best-of-seven-game series. In the 13 years of the salary cap era, the Presidents’ Trophy winners have emerged as overall champions only twice. None of the regular-season winners in the past three years—the Washington Capitals in 2015-16 and 2016-17 and the Nashville Predators in 2017-18—has even advanced past the second round. Using a simple model based on each team’s goals scored and allowed, the average favourite in a playoff head-to-head has a mere 63% chance of advancing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2018-19 Lightning are no average team. Yet the first day of the playoffs, on April 10th, served as a reminder that a short series in a low-scoring sport is never a sure thing. Tampa Bay’s path to the championship began with a 4-3 loss in their first game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, who squeaked into the playoffs as the second wild card in the Eastern Conference. In three head-to-head meetings this year, the Lightning not only won the lot, but also trounced the Blue Jackets by a combined score of 17 goals to 3. Nonetheless, Columbus, like every Eastern Conference team in the playoffs, is no pushover. The Blue Jackets added Matt Duchene and Ryan Dzingel, two veteran forwards, at the February trade deadline, and they boast one of the league’s strongest goaltenders in Sergei Bobrovsky. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://theathletic.com/910662/2019/04/08/2019-nhl-playoff-preview-lightning-vs-blue-jackets/&quot;&gt;series forecast&lt;/a&gt; that incorporated these roster additions, calculated before the surprising first-game result, gave the underdogs a one-in-four chance of progressing to the next round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there were a 75% probability that the Lightning would win each of their four rounds, that would give them less than a one-in-three chance of lifting the Stanley Cup. Betting markets are harsher still, giving them just a one-in-four shot. Two analytics-based models, published by Dom Luszczyszyn of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://theathletic.com/565136/2019/04/06/2018-19-nhl-point-projections-and-playoff-probabilities-updated-daily/&quot;&gt;The Athletic&lt;/a&gt; and Neil Greenberg of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, push that number down to one-in-five. Mr Greenberg’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/04/08/expect-wild-nhl-postseason-with-flames-not-lightning-stanley-cup-favorites/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=.960d87ffeb8c&quot;&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; goes so far as to slightly favor the Calgary Flames to win the championship, as their Western Conference path to the final is likely to pit them against weaker opponents than the ones the Lightning must face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The salary cap limits the effect of market size on team performance, and the NHL playoff structure counter-balances talent with a hefty dose of luck. The Lightning may not hoist the Stanley Cup this year, but most of the squad’s core is under contract well into the next decade, with Mr Kucherov signed until 2025 and Mr Stamkos until 2024. Should they falter in this year’s playoffs, they can take heart from the fate of the Red Wings 1995-96, who fell to the Colorado Avalanche in the conference finals. Neither the 1996-97 and 1997-98 editions of the Red Wings even won their regular-season division, but both accomplished what the 62-win squad could not, by winning the Stanley Cup. Next year’s post-season will offer its own share of obstacles, but Tampa Bay is well positioned to qualify for another bite at the cherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:06:48 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A former pope blames the swinging sixties for clerical crimes]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/04/12/a-former-pope-blames-the-swinging-sixties-for-clerical-crimes]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_BLP508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-12T08:32:24Z&quot;&gt;Apr 12th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUST AS Pope Francis struggles to stop his well-regarded papacy being overshadowed by charges of laxity over child abuse, his predecessor has emerged from retirement to make an unexpected intervention. Benedict, the pope emeritus who turns 92 next week, has blamed a surge of criminal acts against children by clerics on the sexual revolution of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He offered this diagnosis in an essay of nearly 6,000 words that was published in a German monthly, &lt;em&gt;Klerusblatt&lt;/em&gt;, and rapidly retransmitted across the Catholic media. The stated purpose of this contentious piece of writing, which varies from personal reminiscence to dense theological argument, was to assist the deliberations of the current pontiff, who convened a global meeting on child abuse in February after reports of dreadful crimes and cover-ups in countries ranging from Ireland to the United States, and from Chile to Australia. But many supporters of Francis, as well as those who observe the church from outside, will find the older cleric’s analysis far from helpful. Benedict resigned unexpectedly in 2013, becoming the first pontiff to step down for 600 years, and he has lived quietly in Rome since then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Benedict, formerly Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, opens his essay by recalling how he, as a young cleric, experienced the permissiveness that suddenly swept over his native Germany, like all other Western countries, half a century ago. He describes how: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual and pornographic movies became a common occurrence...I still remember seeing, as I was walking through the city of Regensburg one day, crowds of people lining up in front of a large cinema, something we had previously only seen in times of war...I also remember arriving in the city on Good Friday in 1970 and seeing all the billboards plastered with a large poster of two completely naked people in a close embrace.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This anything-goes attitude had an effect on the atmosphere in which Catholic priests were trained, and “in various seminaries homosexual cliques were established,” according to Benedict. He links this to a liberal trend in theology which tried to argue that there was no action which could unconditionally, and in all circumstances, be described as evil. Pope John Paul II, taking office in 1978, had done good work to stem that movement and re-affirm absolute standards in morality, in the retired pope’s view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benedict writes that the child-abuse scandal was a reflection of collapsing ethical norms which in turn flowed from a collapse of private and public faith in God. “Why did pedophilia reach such proportions? Ultimately, the reason is the absence of God...After the upheaval of the second world war, we in Germany had still expressly placed our constitution under the [principle] of responsibility to God. Half a century later it was no longer possible to include responsibility to God as a guiding principle in the European constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the places where clerical abuse has been most extensively investigated, such as the American state of Pennsylvania or the Dublin area, this analysis will be received sceptically. Reports have emerged of awful abuse occurring well before the 1960s, indeed as far back as anyone now alive can recall. The Pennsylvania report published last summer goes back 80 years. If there is a common theme in the whole story, it is that abuse can occur in any situation where representatives of the church (or any other powerful institution) feel they are immune from scrutiny or accountability. One of the ways in which clerics developed that sense of impunity was by presenting themselves as emissaries of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benedict’s argument does contain serious points which would be worth deliberating in a different context, for example a cultural-studies debate. It is perfectly true that in the 1960s and 1970s, public opinion in the Western world was far too inclined (from a 2019 perspective) to turn a blind eye to the sexual manipulation of children. It seems extra-ordinary now that a so-called Pedophile Information Exchange (PIE) was allowed to operate openly, and campaign for the lowering of the age of consent, in Britain from 1974 onwards. What looks obvious now is that the PIE was cynically trying to conflate the campaign for sexual freedom between consenting adults with the exploitation of minors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of the conclusions of the child-abuse summit in Rome in February was precisely that homosexual relations between adults, and child abuse, are two different things which should not be confused. So the existence of “homosexual cliques” in seminaries is off the point for anyone who is trying to understand the root causes of sexual violence against the young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the world, and many rank-and-file Catholics, wants to know now is whether the church has the humility and honesty to acknowledge the ghastliness of child abuse, punish the perpetrators and regain public trust. Whatever the rights and wrongs of history, blaming some malign external influence will not do much to inspire fresh confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(此域名已被污染，谢谢大家一直以来的支持)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:06:24 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sudan’s despot is deposed, and more from our daily podcast]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/12/sudans-despot-is-deposed-and-more-from-our-daily-podcast]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/the_intelligence_52.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-12T11:39:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 12th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;OMAR AL-BASHIR, the president of Sudan since 1989, has stepped down after months of protests against his rule.

The full text of the ERA, which was passed in a storm of controversy in the 1970s, seems unprovocative today: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex”. Yet a renewed push to ratify the amendment looks likely to spark fresh discord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ERA was first proposed by Alice Paul, a leader of the campaign for women’s suffrage, in 1923. With overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate—and support from President Richard Nixon—Congress passed the ERA in 1972. When the measure went to the states (the constitution says that three-fourths must ratify an amendment), its prospects looked good. Within five years, 35 of the required 38 states had signed up. Then nothing happened. The original seven-year deadline for ratification that Congress had placed in the preamble of the amendment was extended to 1982—and still, the remaining three states failed to ratify it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly a century after its introduction, campaigners think they are on the verge of a breakthrough. On March 27th, a group of 22 Senate Democrats, including six presidential hopefuls, reintroduced the ERA in the upper chamber. They have been encouraged by the fact that in 2017 and 2018 Nevada and Illinois became the 36th and 37th states to ratify. Campaigners across the country are taking bets on which state might be the next, and last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 13 states that have not ratified the amendment, many activists see Virginia as the ERA’s best hope. The amendment had previously passed the state Senate, but floundered in the House of Delegates, where it failed in committee again this January. When Democrats proposed a change to House rules to bring the resolution to the floor in February, the measure failed by one vote. Eleanor Smeal, a former president of the National Organisation for Women and a leader of the campaign to pass the ERA in the 1970s and 80s, says proponents of the amendment should not be disappointed. If Democrats win a majority of seats in Virginia’s House elections in November, Mrs Smeal says, they will have the votes. ERA campaigners cherish similar hopes in Arizona and North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the ERA can clear the 38-state hurdle, what will happen next? In a recent op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Senators Ben Cardin and Lisa Murkowski, a Democrat and a Republican, argued that the 1982 deadline was arbitrary, and that Congress “handcuffed itself” by including it in the amendment’s introduction. They have introduced a bill that would remove the deadline, theoretically clearing the way for ratification of the ERA upon passage by a final state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some states have come to regret their ratification. In the 1970s—thanks in large part to an anti-ERA campaign led by Phyllis Schlafly, a firebrand critic of feminism—five states voted to rescind their approval. It is not clear that states have the authority to rescind ratification of a pending amendment. The question made it to the Supreme Court in 1982 with &lt;em&gt;National Organisation for Women v Idaho&lt;/em&gt;, which concerned one of those five states, but as the 10-year deadline for ratification had just expired, the court dismissed the case as unsettled. How would today’s judiciary handle such squabbles? If campaigners call for the ERA’s adoption upon ratification by a 38th state, those five states may mount a legal challenge. “No one really knows how to handle that situation,” says David Strauss, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. “It’s all a great unknown and it’s not clear the Supreme Court would touch that”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question that looms largest over this latest push is whether America still needs the amendment at all. Around half of the states already have some version of the Equal Rights Amendment written into their constitutions. Women in the rest of the country may stand to benefit from a federal standard. However, the legal landscape changed significantly in recent decades. As a lawyer arguing in front of the Supreme Court in the 1970s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped broaden the scope of the 14th Amendment’s equal-protection clause to include discrimination on the basis of sex. Women can now attend what were once all-male military institutes and may not be struck from juries on the basis of their sex, for example. The ERA may not add much to this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist groups on both sides of the ERA debate see larger-stakes issues on the horizon. Many pro-life groups view the amendment as a pernicious attempt by the left to entrench more permissive abortion requirements in the constitution. They quote Jerrold Nadler, a congressman from New York, who in June 2018 pitched the ERA as a bulwark against the possible erosion of Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling recognising a woman’s right to access abortion in the first trimester. “What the Supreme Court giveth, the Supreme Court can taketh away”, he said. That is true. But there is little reason to believe that the ERA, by itself, would stand in for Roe and save abortion rights should the Supreme Court one day dispatch the long-standing precedent. There are, however, other reproductive-rights concerns for which the ERA may provide a constitutional hook in litigation. For example, some ask whether paying childbirth expenses under Medicaid obliges the government to provide funds for medically necessary abortions as well. Another concern involves access to contraceptive care under the Affordable Care Act, which the Supreme Court decided in &lt;em&gt;Burwell v Hobby Lobby&lt;/em&gt; could be denied to women by employers with religious objections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the legal implications, women’s rights activists and legal scholars seem to agree that ratifying the ERA would have symbolic and cultural value. Justice Ginsburg is sceptical that the amendment would make a huge difference to the lives of American women. But she has said that she “would like to be able to take out my pocket constitution and say that the equal citizenship stature of men and women is a fundamental tenet of our society, like free speech”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 03:07:27 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why do India’s elections take so long?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/04/11/why-do-indias-elections-take-so-long]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_BLP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-11T17:05:09Z&quot;&gt;Apr 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALMOST ONE in eight of the world’s adult population is eligible to vote in the election for the next Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament. Something close to one-seventh of them were invited to vote today, April 11th. The rest of the nearly 900m people who may choose to exercise their franchise will wait their turn over the course of the next 37 days, in a series of six more phases. They are staggered, such that about six days pass between each round, and scattered all over the country, in a splotchy-looking map that the Election Commission of India has calibrated carefully. One effect is that no one will know who won any given seat—let alone whether the prime minister, Narendra Modi, keeps control of the government, or lets it slip to some unfathomable assembly of opposition parties—until May 23rd. That morning all the ballots are to be counted within just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why draw out the voting like this? The seven-phase calendar imposes practical difficulties of its own. There are strict rules that are supposed to prevent news of polling in any one area from affecting the voting decisions made in another. (Let’s never mind the bated breath of a billion-odd people waiting for an outcome.) But here is the catch: those same strictures, the “model code of conduct”, are what make the slow and steady pace necessary. The code is implemented by a roving company of administrators, backed up by an enormous number of police and paramilitary forces. Getting from one part of the country to another takes time; some of India’s 1m polling stations are still extremely remote. The whole state of Arunachal Pradesh, next to the border with Myanmar, voted today, which meant that 32 officials had to be airlifted into a deep forested valley. The Election Commission is nowadays most concerned with ensuring a fair and well publicised vote, but in wilder times it was also responsible for protecting ballot boxes from being stuffed or stolen, or candidates kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get our daily newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor&amp;#x27;s Picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; required=&quot;&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email address&quot;  aria-label=&quot;Subscription mail&quot;/&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Sign up now&quot; /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_WOM916.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190413_WOM916.png 200w,

Several of the states that went to the polls today managed their voting in one go: Arunachal in the north-east, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh around the south-central Deccan plateau, and Uttarakhand in the Himalayas north of Delhi. These are all relatively peaceful places (notwithstanding the odd Maoist attack in the south). By contrast the northern and eastern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, across the most densely populated and also the poorest belt of all, are broken up into seven parts each. They are also notorious for their rough-and-tumble politics, and the thuggery that comes with it. The Kashmir valley in the far north is not nearly so thick with people, but its security problems are even more intense; it is the other place to keep the commissioners busy through April and May.&lt;p&gt;The staggering is the one thing that has brought the Election Commission the least criticism. In this fevered season opposition parties, NGOs and other observers all see the tables being tilted against them. Every day brings a new complaint, and sometimes even redress. On April 10th the commission ruled that a hagiographical film biopic about Mr Modi cannot be released until after the election, and also that “NaMo TV”, a mysterious new satellite channel, must be counted as pro-Modi advertising. Such enforcement of the model code will continue through the election itself. On April 12th the Supreme Court is to decide whether “electoral bonds”, a new method of funnelling corporate donations anonymously into party coffers, should be voided midway through the voting. Lots of work left to do, only 37 days and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 02:06:21 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sudan ousts its dictator, how to get more kidney donors and Donald Trump as a pro wrestler]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/11/sudan-ousts-its-dictator-how-to-get-more-kidney-donors-and-donald-trump-as-a-pro-wrestler]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/editors_picks_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-11T16:37:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SELECTION of three essential articles read aloud from the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;The Economis&lt;/em&gt;t.

The event’s adopted slogan, “a tradition unlike any other”, is a fair claim. The Masters is by far the most popular event on the golfing calendar, drawing nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.statista.com/statistics/244272/golf-tournaments-viewership-us&quot;&gt;twice as large a television audience&lt;/a&gt; in the United States as its peers do. It is the most exclusive of the game’s marquee events, fielding around 90 players rather than the standard 156, though all former champions receive a permanent invitation to participate every year—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/apr/08/golf.masters20051&quot;&gt;no matter how old they are&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only one of the four majors played at the same venue every year: the Augusta National golf club, an institution so set in its ways it refused to admit women as members until 2012. And the garish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.golf-monthly.co.uk/tour/us-masters/masters-history-records/masters-green-jacket-126753&quot;&gt;green jacket&lt;/a&gt; presented to each Masters victor is seen as so precious that even the champion himself cannot keep it in his closet permanently. Instead, he can sport it only during the year of his reign. Afterwards, he must return it to Augusta National, and can wear it only when visiting the club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to most tournaments in individual sports, attention from fans and media focuses mainly on the top handful of players. Not so in 2019, when the lion’s share of golfing discussion has focused on a competitor who does not even figure among the top ten in the official world rankings. Of course, that golfer happens to be named Tiger Woods, who at his best was the greatest player the sport has ever seen. After losing nearly a decade to injuries and scandal, Mr Woods has mounted an impressive comeback during the past year. In September he won his first official event since 2013, and he was among the leaders on the final day of both of the past two major tournaments. Betting markets currently give him a healthy 5% chance of claiming his 15th major crown at Augusta this year, trailing only the top three on the official rankings (Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the public’s rediscovered affection for Mr Woods—now seen as a scrappy underdog rather than a reckless, entitled superstar—may be clouding the markets’ judgment. Since 2016 &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; has produced a statistical prediction model for men’s major golf tournaments called EAGLE (&lt;i&gt;Economist&lt;/i&gt; Advantage in Golf Likelihood Estimator). It calculates each player’s probability of winning an event based on his past performance; the configuration and scoring history of the course; and, once a tournament begins, all of the results recorded so far. In the past, EAGLE has only appeared as a projected leaderboard. This year, however, we are pleased to display all of its predictions on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://eagle.economist.com&quot;&gt;new, interactive data-visualisation site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_WOC924.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190413_WOC924.png 200w,

As our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/06/our-masters-forecast-is-lukewarm-on-tiger-woods&quot;&gt;article in this week’s print edition &lt;/a&gt; shows, the current version of Mr Woods is not only a shadow of his former self, but is also inferior to many other modern golfers with far thinner résumés. For a 43-year-old, Mr Woods is performing exceedingly well: EAGLE predicts he would shoot around 0.4 strokes above par per 18 holes on a course of average difficulty for a major, ranking him among the world’s ten best players. Unfortunately, to win the Masters he will need to defeat several dozen competitors who are still in the prime of youth. EAGLE gives him a modest 2% probability of victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if not Mr Woods, who is most likely to don the green jacket? Mr Rose, who reached a sudden-death playoff at Augusta in 2017 but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2017/04/10/how-bad-was-sergio-garcias-barren-run&quot;&gt;lost to Sergio García&lt;/a&gt;, currently sits atop the official world rankings. Betting markets see Mr McIlroy, who has finished among the top ten in all seven events he has played this year, as a clear favourite, with an 11% chance to win, nearly twice Mr Rose’s 6%. EAGLE also considers both of these stars to be leading candidates—but gives them around a 5% probability of victory, suggesting that Mr McIlroy is rather over-valued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is the 34-year-old Mr Johnson whom the model sees as the leading contender in the field. Both he and Mr McIlroy have been on top of their games at the start of 2019. But golf is a fickle sport: even with no change in underlying skill, players’ scores vary vastly from day to day, thanks to the vagaries of course conditions and the random chance inherent in propelling a ball so small over distances so long. As a result, it takes very large samples of data to yield reliable estimates of golfers’ ability. Whereas human handicappers tend to place a heavy emphasis on recent form and mostly ignore results more than a few months old, EAGLE takes the long view. It factors in scores from a full year ago at around two-fifths of the impact of current data, and even incorporates rounds two years in the past (albeit at just one-sixth of the weight of a scorecard submitted yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr McIlroy has proven he can win consistently on the biggest of stages, with four major titles before he turned 26. In contrast, questions still abound regarding the intestinal fortitude of the 34-year-old Mr Johnson, who has only one major championship to his name despite being five years older than Mr McIlroy. By design, however, EAGLE pays no heed to such arguments: with just four majors played per year, and so much good fortune required to beat such strong competition, there is no statistically reliable method to distinguish “clutch” or choke-prone golfers from those who are merely unlucky. (The model’s indifference to such criticisms was perhaps the main reason why it saw Mr García, who won his first major at the Masters at the age of 37, as one of the entrants most under-rated by betting markets entering the tournament.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, EAGLE disregards Mr McIlroy’s glittering trophy case, and focuses instead on his relative stumbles late last year—such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.rte.ie/sport/golf/2018/1026/1006791-mcilroy-finds-water-twice-at-the-same-hole-in-torrid-77&quot;&gt;second-round 77&lt;/a&gt; at the WGC-HSBC Champions in October. Although Mr Johnson is hardly immune to a bad round, his duds have simply been fewer and less disastrous than Mr McIlroy’s during the past year. Meanwhile, his finest moments have been even more impressive than his Northern Irish rival’s have. In February he shot 61 en route to winning the Saudi International, a showing that in EAGLE’s estimation was the third-best round of the past year (trailing only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.europeantour.com/challengetour/season=2018/tournamentid=2018762/news/newsid=357957.html&quot;&gt;60 by Matt Ford&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2018/tournamentid=2018078/news/newsid=357890.html&quot;&gt;59 by Oliver Fisher&lt;/a&gt; that set a European Tour record). Under typical conditions for a major, EAGLE predicts Mr Johnson to come in 0.3 strokes below par per round. With Mr McIlroy (and Mr Rose) both forecasted at just about even par, that edge translates into an 8% chance of victory for the occasionally star-crossed Mr Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in any golf tournament with a large field, however, if you are asked which of the favourites is likely to win, the correct answer is “none of the above”. Over a mere 72 holes, a few strokes of good luck—literally and figuratively—count for far more than a substantive difference in skill. In the past 12 majors, just two of the victors were among the top five in the official rankings at the times when they won. If history and statistics are any guide, whoever gets to pick the menu at the Masters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.augusta.com/masters/story/news/2019-04-08/patrick-reed-serving-his-favorites-champions-dinner&quot;&gt;champions’ dinner&lt;/a&gt; next year will probably be a player only keen golf fans have heard of—but who has already demonstrated enough skill to compete with the world’s best if everything breaks his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EAGLE’s favourite player in this tier is Patrick Cantlay. Once a highly touted amateur, Mr Cantlay’s career was derailed for three years by back injuries. Save for one event that seems to bring out the best in him—the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, which he won in 2017 and finished second in the following year—he has rarely challenged for victories. However, his overall scoring record is close to elite: by EAGLE’s reckoning, his average card during the past year has been better than those of Bryson DeChambeau and Francesco Molinari, currently ranked sixth and seventh in the world. The model gives Mr Cantlay just over a 2% chance of securing the green jacket, more than double the 1% chance bettors assign to him. It is of course possible that Mr Cantlay just does not have what it takes to win the big one. But the odds that he does are surely greater than one in 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a tournament gets underway, everyone is a long shot. By EAGLE’s assessment, even Mr Woods at the height of his powers had a 75% chance of losing each major he entered. Once golfers start registering scores, however, the odds start to fluctuate—modestly in the early rounds, violently on Sunday afternoon. When numerous players of varying abilities are bunched together on the leaderboard, even the savviest fan would struggle to determine just how close each of them is to securing the green jacket. EAGLE, in contrast, takes just a minute or two to digest all of this information and produce a precise estimate of where everyone stands. By the end of April 14th, one player’s probability of victory will soar to 100%, while everyone else’s will collapse to zero. We hope you consult EAGLE’s forecasts regularly along that journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 23:07:18 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to knit a sports car with carbon fibre]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/04/13/how-to-knit-a-sports-car-with-carbon-fibre]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190413_STP001_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-13T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 13th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;ERTHA RESIDES&lt;/small&gt; on a quiet industrial estate in Bristol, in the west of Britain. The affectionate name has been given to what at first appears to be a giant loom from the Industrial Revolution. And in some ways it is. Bertha (pictured above) is an automated braiding machine. Like a horizontal maypole, ribbons of carbon fibre are drawn from 288 bobbins contained on a pair of huge rings, and passed over and under one another as they are wound tightly around a revolving mould. The final product could be a propeller for an aeroplane, a ship’s hydrofoil or a set of wheels for a sports car. In fact, Bertha can knit just about any hollow component up to 800mm by ten metres, and do so quickly and accurately by depositing some 300kg of carbon fibre an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as textile production began to be mechanised at the end of the 18th century, creating the modern factory, manufacturing is going through another revolution. This time it is driven by digital processes and new materials, such as carbon-fibre composites. Automated braiders are one of several new systems turning carbon-fibre production from a slow, labour-intensive craft into a mass-manufacturing process that will change many industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon fibre is attractive because it is lightweight and exceptionally strong. The toughest fibres are up to ten times stronger than steel and eight times more so than aluminium, reckons Zoltek, an American carbon-fibre producer. Carbon fibre is also five times lighter than steel and half the weight, or less, of aluminium. Nor does it corrode. In transport industries, where “lightweighting” is most valuable, carbon fibre allows aircraft and cars to be made lighter and so travel farther on the same amount of fuel or a single charge of their batteries. This will help them meet tougher emissions targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are other advantages, too. One is that carbon fibre allows manufacturers to make much larger, more complex parts in one go, says Richard Oldfield, chief executive of the National Composites Centre (&lt;small&gt;NCC&lt;/small&gt;), a research laboratory set up by the University of Bristol, and home to Bertha. Instead of making an aircraft’s wing or car body by welding, riveting and bolting together hundreds of individual components, these bits can be consolidated into a single carbon-fibre structure. This saves time and materials and allows designers to come up with novel products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 &gt;Hot stuff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers got interested in carbon fibre in the 1960s. The fibres consist of carbonised polymers, made up of long strings of molecules bound together by the powerful bonds between carbon atoms. The fibres are made by heating a precursor material to around 3,000°C in a protective atmosphere of inert gases. The most commonly used precursor is polyacrylonitrile (&lt;small&gt;PAN&lt;/small&gt;), which is produced by the petrochemicals industry. Pitch, obtained from coal tar, is sometimes used instead. Once carbonised, the fibres are wound onto bobbins, spun into yarns or formed into tapes. Depending on the final application, they can also be woven into fabric sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their own, carbon fibres are brittle and can break easily. But their strength comes in tension (they resist being pulled apart). So, the fibres need to be aligned in such a way to impart their strength by distributing loads throughout a structure. This is done by placing the fibres, tapes or mats onto a mould in the required orientation, creating what is known as a preform. It is a slow process often done by hand. This is now being automated, aided by the fact that the optimal alignment of the fibres is often calculated using sophisticated computer-aided design systems, and the same data can program robots to lay-up the fibres or wind them on braiding machines such as Bertha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preforms then need to be made solid. This is done by impregnating the fibres with a chemically activated resin, which hardens when it is cured. The curing process is usually carried out inside a large oven called an autoclave, which applies heat and pressure to consolidate the structure and force out any air bubbles. It can take hours, sometimes with autoclaves left to run overnight. For a relatively low throughput this might not be a problem. But for higher volumes, especially in carmaking, faster cycle times are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various out-of-autoclave curing techniques are starting to be used. One is resin transfer moulding (&lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt;). This involves placing preforms inside a mould which is then closed. Resin is injected into the mould and heat and pressure applied. Depending on what is being produced, &lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt; can cut processing times by half or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 &gt;Fast cars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLaren has been making sports cars out of carbon fibre since the British company used the material for the world’s first Formula 1 racing car in 1981. All &lt;small&gt;F1&lt;/small&gt; cars are now made from carbon fibre, and the protection it affords drivers has allowed many to walk away from spectacular crashes. To build its sports cars the company starts with a carbon-fibre “MonoCell”, a giant tub which forms the main structure of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company uses a specialist contractor to make MonoCells, although those for future car models will be produced at a new £50m ($65m) McLaren Composites Technology Centre in Sheffield, Britain. The first of the new cells has just been delivered. Impressively, the large and complicated structures are produced with &lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt; in one go—although McLaren is keeping the details secret. “I often look at the MonoCell and wonder myself how it is possible to make it,” says Claudio Santoni, the centre’s technical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLaren says carbon fibre will be essential in keeping weight down in future hybrid and electric models. By 2025 it expects the centre to be making MonoCells for some 6,000 cars a year. As a high-end brand, it is not seeking large volumes. But other carmakers are. One is &lt;small&gt;BMW&lt;/small&gt;, which uses a variant of &lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt; in Leipzig, Germany, to make bodies for more than 130 of its i3 electric cars every day. &lt;small&gt;BMW&lt;/small&gt; plans to increase that number substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another speedy production process is “overmoulding”. This combines sheets of carbon fibre with injection-moulded plastic. Injection moulding has long been used to produce plastic parts by extruding a molten polymer into a mould. It is quick and accurate. By combining the two processes, overmoulding allows plastic parts to be selectively reinforced with carbon fibre. Thus strengthened, such parts could be used as car doors, aircraft interiors and in many other products. The &lt;small&gt;NCC&lt;/small&gt; reckons an overmoulding system it is working with in Bristol can churn out finished components in just 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress is also being made in reducing the cost of carbon fibre itself. Prices vary according to quality, but industrial-grade carbon fibre is roughly $20 a kilogram, although aerospace versions are more expensive. By comparison, steel used in carmaking is about $1 a kilogram. As carbon fibre is so much lighter and stronger than steel, less material is needed. And the additional cost is also compensated for by product-lifetime savings on fuel and emissions. Nevertheless, cheaper carbon fibre would find greater use in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee thinks it could cut the cost of industrial-grade carbon fibre by about half with more efficient production processes. According to some estimates, roughly 90% of the energy needed to make things with carbon composites is consumed in producing the fibre itself. Oak Ridge is looking at the use of cheaper alternatives to &lt;small&gt;PAN&lt;/small&gt; and low-temperature carbonisation processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab also uses chopped-up carbon fibre in large-scale &lt;small&gt;3D&lt;/small&gt; printers to produce structures. It recently employed the system to print moulds for the precast concrete façade of the Domino tower, a new 42-storey building in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chopped carbon fibres can be made from manufacturing offcuts or recycled material. Recycling will become even more important once a greater number of carbon-fibre cars, aircraft, ships, wind turbines and other products reach the end of their working lives. There will be mountains of the black stuff to deal with. Companies are coming up with ways to recover the fibres, usually with heat or chemicals. Sometimes the fibres can be re-spun, but if they are too short they can still be suitable for parts subject to less stress. A combination of lower-cost mass-production techniques and effective carbon-fibre recycling, will lead to a lot more Berthas knitting away furiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Science and technology&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;How to knit a sports car&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:06:44 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
