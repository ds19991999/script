In the early morning of April 30th he stood outside the La Carlota air-force base in Caracas, the capital, to proclaim that Operación Libertad, or Operation Liberty, the final push to free Venezuela from the dictatorial regime of Nicolás Maduro, had begun.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A few signs suggested that Mr Guaidó, who is supported by millions of Venezuelans suffering from regime-inflicted hunger and other hardships, might have the sort of backing needed to remove it. A video showed him surrounded by a small group of soldiers wearing blue armbands, signalling support for his movement. Some armoured cars were parked behind them.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;More important, Mr Guaidó was joined by Leopoldo López, once the country’s most popular opposition leader, who had been jailed in 2014 and later placed under house arrest. He said he had been freed by agents from SEBIN, Venezuela’s intelligence service, who had been keeping him under guard. That suggests that his jailers, at least, had switched sides. Videos appeared of small groups of armed men joining protesters against the regime. Mr Guaidó declared that “brave soldiers...have followed our call.”&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;But for Mr Guaidó to wrest power from Mr Maduro, troops will have to defect in large numbers, and that is likely to happen only if their commanders do, too. Rumours of high-level defections circulated throughout the morning. Questions revolved around Manuel Figuera, the general in charge of SEBIN, who has not been heard from. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the afternoon the United States’ national-security adviser, John Bolton, suggested that more high-level defections were expected. He asserted that &amp;quot;key figures in the regime” had been “talking to the opposition over these last three months” and called on them to “make good on their commitments to achieve the peaceful transfer of power from the Maduro clique” to Mr Guaidó. Among those prepared to defect, he asserted, were the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, the supreme court’s chief justice, Maikel Moreno, and the commander of the presidential guard, Iván Rafael Hernández Dala.” All of them “agreed that Maduro had to go,” Mr Bolton claimed. He told them to “act this afternoon or this evening to help bring other military forces” to Mr Guaidó’s side. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Whether these regime stalwarts had indeed agreed to dump Mr Maduro is unclear. Certainly, the United States has long wanted them to. By, in effect, declaring them to be disloyal to the regime, Mr Bolton may be hoping to force them to take action against it. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Before his intervention, most of the people popularly thought to be high-level rebels appeared to have confirmed their loyalty to the regime. José Ornellas, the chief of the armed forces, whom unsubstantiated reports said was the leader of the rebellion, tweeted his backing for Mr Maduro. So did Mr Padrino López. Some informed observers think the rising went off at half-cock: it had been planned for another day, with the support of senior officers, but was brought forward because the regime was about to arrest Mr Guaidó and the coup plotters then backed down. Mr Bolton asserted that the Cubans, who spy on the Venezuelan armed forces and feed the intelligence to Mr Maduro, “played a very significant role in propping Maduro up today, possibly with help from the Russians”.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The most senior officer known to have joined the rebellion seems to be a lieutenant-colonel of the National Guard charged with guarding the opposition-controlled national assembly. The protesters around Mr Guaidó failed to enter the La Carlota base. They were fended off by rounds of teargas. The repression appeared to turn brutal. Images on social media showed a National Guard armoured car running over demonstrators. By late morning Diosdado Cabello, perhaps the regime’s second-most-powerful figure, was declaring that “the traitors to the country have once again been defeated”.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;For now, it looks as if Mr Guaidó is left with the tactic of mobilising opposition on the streets, until now his main way of putting pressure on the regime. He has called for the largest demonstration in Venezuela’s history to take place on May 1st. Radicals are urging Mr Guaidó to head directly towards the presidential palace. Others warn that may be a futile gesture: routes to the palace are easily blocked by loyalist security forces.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In short, events in Venezuela remain unpredictable. It is still too soon for the regime to declare victory. It is unclear what effect, if any, Mr Bolton’s claim to be outing top regime officials will have. Mr Maduro himself has not appeared in public. The march may well be yet another reminder to exasperated citizens that whereas Mr Guaidó has the popular support, the president still has the guns. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If so, the initiative may soon pass to the regime. Its first decision will be whether to allow Mr Guaidó, to remain free. (Mr López and his family have found refuge at the Chilean embassy.) The government has so far permitted Mr Guaidó to agitate largely unmolested, no doubt in part because the United States has warned of reprisals if he is arrested. Until the events of April 30th, the regime had tried to avoid killing people at recent protests. If they swell it may begin to repress them more forcibly.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Another possibility is that the opposition will lose heart. Mr Guaidó’s last big gambit—an attempt in February to bring in humanitarian aid from Colombia watched by the world’s media—was a failure. Another could demoralise the opposition. The United States and most Latin American countries have given Mr Guaidó full-throated support. This has been backed by American sanctions on Venezuela’s vital oil industry. President Donald Trump has now threatened a “full and complete embargo” against Cuba, blaming it for helping to keep Mr Maduro in power. But the pressure has yet to break the regime. It is not clear how many setbacks Mr Guaidó and his allies can tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 07:06:38 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Juan Guaidó makes another dramatic attempt to dislodge Venezuela’s regime]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/30/juan-guaido-makes-another-dramatic-attempt-to-dislodge-venezuelas-regime]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_AMP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-30T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 30th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUAN GUAIDÓ, recognised by most Western and Latin American democracies as Venezuela’s interim president, seems to have decided it was now or never to claim real power.

In some two dozen states that do not have their own civil-rights umbrella for LGBT people, a gay employee can return to the office from his honeymoon and be fired. Transgender people, too, have no recourse in these states when their bosses fire or demote them for presenting themselves as their preferred gender. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a push for greater equality has had some success at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in several federal appeals courts which have pointed to protection against employment discrimination for LGBT in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Meanwhile, the Trump administration and other courts are sticking to less expansive readings of that law. After months of discussion in private conference, on April 22nd the Supreme Court agreed to resolve the split. Late in 2019, the justices will take up gay rights for the first time since Justice Anthony Kennedy—author of the same-sex marriage decision and a trio of rulings forging a path to it—left the bench last June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the cases come up for argument, the main quandary will concern how to interpret three words Congress wrote over a half-century ago: “because of sex”. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act bars employers from discriminating against a worker “because of such individual’s race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin”. The question is whether skipping over a gay worker for a promotion or firing her on the basis of her sexual orientation amounts to discrimination “because of sex”—and whether similar treatment of trans people fits that bill.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the cases—&lt;em&gt;Altitude Express, Inc. v Zarda &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Bostock v Clayton County, Georgia&lt;/em&gt;—involve gay men. Donald Zarda, a sky-diving instructor, and Gerald Bostock, a child-advocate employee, both say their sexual orientation (and in Mr Bostock’s case, his participation in a gay softball league) cost them their jobs. Mr Zarda died in a jumping accident in Switzerland before the litigation began but won a posthumous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.glad.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/zarda-second-circuit-opinion-2-26-18.pdf&quot;&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018. Judge Robert Katzmann found that discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation is “a subset of sex discrimination” since it is rooted in stereotypes about “how persons of a certain sex can or should be”. To sack “a man because he is attracted to men is a decision motivated, at least in part, by sex”. By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals curtly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/17-1618-opinion-below.pdf&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; Mr Bostock’s claim, finding it foreclosed by a 1979 precedent which concluded that “[d]ischarge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R.G. &amp;amp; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,&lt;/em&gt; the third case, poses two slightly different questions about a transgender woman, Aimee Stephens, who lost her job at a funeral home when she told her boss she would no longer dress or present herself as Anthony. The Supreme Court will ask whether dismissing employees based on their “status as transgender” violates Title VII. It will also consider whether discriminating based on “sex stereotyping” violates the law. The issues are connected but analytically distinguishable: it could conceivably be acceptable to fire someone for being transgender as long as the reason is not linked to any particular behaviour or practice. The violation of Ms Stephens’s civil rights could be traced to the boss’s refusal to let her wear a dress to work and present herself as a woman, not to a general policy of disdain for transgender employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction may sound fine, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals based its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0045p-06.pdf&quot;&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; in favour of Ms Stephens squarely on the sex-stereotyping claim. In urging the justices not to hear the appeal, Ms Stephens &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-107/67903/20181024150403351_18-107%20RGGR%20Harris%20Funeral%20Homes%20v%20EEOC%20Brief%20in%20Opposition.pdf&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; the case was a poor vehicle for considering whether Title VII bars discrimination according to gender identity. The funeral home fired Ms Stephens’s, her lawyers wrote, “because her appearance and behaviour failed to conform to its sex stereotypes”. That type of discrimination “requires no determination of whether discrimination based on transgender status itself constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII”. Instead, it is universally acknowledged by all appeals courts to be barred by &lt;em&gt;Price Waterhouse v Hopkins,&lt;/em&gt; a 1989 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/87-1167&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; in which the Supreme Court read Title VII to preclude employers from disfavouring female workers based on “stereotypical notions about women&amp;#x27;s proper deportment”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main strike against the plaintiffs in these three cases is obvious: none of the lawmakers in Congress in 1964 believed they were barring LGBT discrimination when they included “sex” among the prohibited bases of differential treatment in the workplace. But that is not the end of the story, even—perhaps especially—for conservative justices who purport to be textualists. More than two decades ago, Justice Antonin Scalia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.oyez.org/cases/1997/96-568&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; a unanimous majority opinion in &lt;em&gt;Oncale v Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc&lt;/em&gt; vindicating another claim that never crossed the minds of the mid-century legislators: a male employee’s right not to be harassed at work. Sexual harassment of men may not have been among the evils members of Congress thought they were combating when they drafted the Civil Rights Act, but the workplace harm is “reasonably comparable” to others Congress was thinking of. What should matter for a textualist are the words in the statute, not the motivations of its authors. “It is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators”, Mr Scalia wrote, “by which we are governed”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 04:06:33 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Britain’s super-rich are Corbyn-proofing their finances]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/04/30/britains-super-rich-are-corbyn-proofing-their-finances]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_blp904.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-30T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 30th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;JEREMY CORBYN may have it in for tax havens, but they are not all cursing the Labour leader right now. Well-heeled types worried about the prospect of a Corbyn-led government have been buying property on Guernsey with a view to relocating to the island, attracted by its flat 20% income-tax rate and lack of capital-gains or inheritance taxes. Demand for homes there has been buoyant this year, and Jo Stoddart of Locate Guernsey, an investment-promotion agency, says queasiness over Mr Corbyn is one of the main reasons (along with Brexit and personal security). Matt Brouard, a Guernsey estate agent, says some British expats are moving to the island rather than returning to the mainland after stints working overseas, partly because of Corbyn-induced uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition leader makes no secret of his disdain for the rich. The real divide in Britain, he said recently, is not over Brexit but “between the many, who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes, and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and dodge their taxes.” The super-rich, he has warned, are “on borrowed time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small wonder, then, that plutocrats are seeking advisers’ counsel—and increasingly taking action—to keep their incomes, mansions and pensions out of Labour’s clutches. “How to Corbyn-proof your Wealth”, an event held in London in February by a club for elite investors, sold out quickly. A recent, eight-page special section on the topic in the &lt;em&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/em&gt; screamed that Corbynomics threatens to wreak economic havoc that could “rival that heaped upon the poor people of Venezuela”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betting sites offer odds as short as 3/1 on Mr Corbyn becoming the next prime minister (he is jostling with Boris Johnson, a leading Tory, for top spot). If that happened, says the chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, the rich would “take all the money offshore, wait for the economy to crash, and come back and get richer.” There would be “a major crash in the pound and [firms] will all start losing jobs.” Private-client advisers have warned of Britain’s multi-millionaires moving up to £1trn ($1.3trn) out of the country. But the “mass affluent”, those with liquid assets in the hundreds of thousands, also have cause to fret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such fears have fluctuated in line with recent political turmoil. Wealth advisers interviewed for this article agreed that clients worry more about Mr Corbyn than Brexit—though the two are linked, as some fear a disorderly Brexit precisely because it could usher in a Labour government. When clients of Saunderson House, a wealth manager, were asked last October what was the biggest threat to their finances, the top answer, mentioned by 42%, was a change of government. The number would almost certainly be higher now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worries fall into three main categories. The first concerns existing tax and pension arrangements. Labour is likely to target pension tax relief for high earners. On income tax, it has promised to reintroduce the 50% rate on earnings over £123,000 (rather than £150,000), and add a 45% rate that kicks in at £80,000. It is likely to reverse cuts to capital-gains tax made by the Tories. And it is expected to tighten the inheritance-tax regime, possibly by reducing or removing allowances for those giving to discretionary trusts, passing on property or handing gifts to relatives. To cap it all, Labour’s manifesto pledges to impose VAT on private-school fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second area is brand new taxes. Labour hopes to raise almost £5bn a year from a new financial-transactions levy. This would cream 0.2% off every transaction executed by financial firms. Some hedge funds are reportedly considering moving management overseas in response. The bigger worry is the possibility of a general “wealth tax” on assets, perhaps focused on high-value homes, to help fund social care. In 2012 John McDonnell, who has since become shadow chancellor, backed a proposal for a one-off, 20% wealth tax to help reduce government debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third category—and the biggest bogeyman—is the spectre of capital controls, measures to restrict the flow of capital in and out of the country, in the event of severe economic turbulence. Labour has repeatedly denied it would consider such a draconian measure, last seen in Britain in the late 1970s. Even Mr Corbyn’s harshest critics see it as a long shot. Nevertheless, contingency plans are being put in place. A year ago, says Mr Tait, it would have seemed “ludicrous” to be mulling measures to protect against capital controls. Yet clients raised the issue in “around half” of the meetings he attended in the run-up to Easter. As an “insurance policy”, some have arranged for custody of their investment accounts (used to buy and sell securities) to be moved to the Channel Islands or Switzerland. Changing the jurisdiction in which accounts are booked in this way is all about “asset access” and has nothing to do with tax, says Mr Tait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a possible property-based wealth tax in mind, some rich folk are accelerating the transfer of homes to children. “They might have done this anyway when the kids were in their 20s. Now they’re doing it in their teens,” says one adviser, who has “dozens” of clients who have opted to speed up handovers. Some are also using up tax-free pension allowances, or vesting tax-free cash, earlier than required, for fear of such benefits evaporating under Labour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smaller number are exploring taking themselves offshore. Rather than emigrating now, the majority of these Jeremiahs are looking to buy foreign residence permits to hold alongside their British passports, in order to be well placed to hop abroad if things turn nasty at home. Advisers say they are looking not only at obvious places like Monaco and the Channel Islands but also at EU countries that have become friendlier to rich foreigners, such as Portugal (where a “golden visa” can be bought for €500,000, or $561,000) and Italy (where, since 2017, income from abroad can be taxed at a flat €100,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who may be tempted to up sticks are resident “non-doms”: foreigners who live in Britain but declare their domicile as elsewhere to avoid tax on their non-British income. The Tories took away some of their privileges in 2016, after a media outcry over their cushy deal, but the non-doms still get fairly generous treatment for up to 15 years. The threat of a Corbyn government, though, is leading some who were wavering after the changes in 2016 to go elsewhere. Another wealth adviser has Swedish and French non-dom clients who are returning home. “Sweden and France, those well-known tax havens!” he guffaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were Britain’s 90,000 or so non-doms to leave, many Corbynistas might say good riddance. Indeed, some Labour advisers believe that a falling-out with the super-rich would go down well with the public. Mr Corbyn has long accused them of using Britain to dodge tax and contributing little to the economy. But non-doms contributed a not-so-paltry £9.4bn in tax—equivalent to a third of the transport budget—in the year to April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr McDonnell’s team dismisses the bleating from Belgravia as alarmist. Fears over a wealth tax are as misplaced as those concerning capital controls, aides say. Yes, income tax will rise, but to nowhere near the stomach-churning rates of the 1970s. Mr McDonnell may have an avowedly Marxist past, but he has been on a charm offensive in the City, meeting moneymen to assure them he has nothing shocking up the sleeves of his branch-manager suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when it comes to squeezing the rich there is not as much clear blue water between the two main parties as the Tories would have voters believe. As well as turning the screws on non-doms, the current lot have cut high earners’ tax-free pension allowances and are mulling an inheritance-tax grab. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has warned of the need for higher taxes to fund an ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, tone matters, and there is a difference between measured tax increases, served up apologetically, and what looks to some like anti-capitalist blood-lust. Mr Corbyn has said he is “coming for” the rich. Some of Labour’s plans suggest a taste for confiscation. It wants to nationalise several industries, including water, for which it is considering basing compensation for investors on “book” value—currently a third of the industry’s market value—or even less. A plan to snatch 10% of shares in big British firms and give them to workers and the state has nauseated many business leaders. “The rich are prepared for higher taxes,” says Bobby Vedral of MacroEagle, a political and economic intelligence firm, “but not for expropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Vedral caused a ruckus in 2017 when he predicted a Britain led by Mr Corbyn would be like “Cuba without the sun”. That is unfair—but increasing numbers of the moneyed seem unwilling to take any chances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 04:06:32 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don’t genetically enhance people—improve society instead]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/04/30/dont-genetically-enhance-people-improve-society-instead]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_OPP505.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-30T17:36:31Z&quot;&gt;Apr 30th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a by-invitation commentary as part of The Economist’s Open Future initiative, which is designed to spur a global conversation across the ideological spectrum on individual rights, markets and technology.

But not all of them are appropriate to living in a well-functioning society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, all pregnant women in Britain are offered a screening test for Down’s syndrome. Yet researchers believe they can screen embryos and identify the genes responsible for traits that are not diseases or disorders, such as intelligence and height. Clinics in America already offer clients information on whether an embryo is likely to develop into a person with a below average IQ. And the rollout of facial-predicting technology is said to be just a few years away. Soon clinics will be able to show parents an image of what each embryo will look like as a person. Some clinics in America already offer eye-colour selecting services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people might regard these developments as a straightforward liberal expansion of choice. Why not offer parents the opportunity to have the kind of child they desire? Having a higher IQ is statistically more likely to lead to better life outcomes, after all. If we already permit the testing for Down’s syndrome because we believe a child without this condition will have a better life, why not extend this justification beyond disorders to traits that might lead to better lives, such as musical ability, height or intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_OPP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190504_OPP504.jpg 200w,

That we currently screen for Down’s syndrome should not be taken as an axiomatic and unproblematic starting point. Many disability-rights organisations oppose screening, as they believe it is inimical to adequately valuing the lives of the disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is understandable that today, parents might choose to select against Down’s syndrome. People with this condition require greater care, and many will not be able to have ordinary jobs or live fully independent lives. Yet this could be improved by making changes to our institutions. Although there is certainly a medical-impairment aspect to disability, it also has a significant socially-imposed element to it—and this can be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society could be arranged to make it easier for people to live with or care for those with disabilities, by improving care arrangements and accessibility to services. Given the lack of support, it seems inevitable that having a child with Down’s syndrome is stressful and strenuous. The structures just aren’t in place for it to be any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, intelligence. We ought to question why it is that IQ is such a predictor of life outcomes—and whether this is right. High IQ influences life outcomes because it is correlated with wealth, and it is correlated with wealth because one’s wealth is often determined by one’s job. Wealth is essential to maintaining good nutrition and a healthy lifestyle, which contributes to overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet we ought to question whether it is right that intelligence, wealth and the job we hold determine life outcomes so much in the first place. That is something which should be addressed, rather than reified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, appearance. Evidence suggests that those who are perceived as more attractive are more successful. There is also a “halo effect” that causes one trait (like perceived beauty) to drastically alter our perception of other traits. If we think someone is attractive, we are also likely to assume they’re smart, ambitious and interesting, as well as kinder and friendlier. Why not give your child the best chance in life by maximising the possibility that they are seen this way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, perceived attractiveness is heavily influenced by our social and cultural norms, and it might be a bad idea to reinforce them if they tend to exclude people or privilege certain appearances (such as being white or thin). We ought to be seeking to remove such biases, rather than entrenching their hold on our decision-making and interactions with others. Women remain judged on their appearance more so than men, so it seems plausible to hypothesise that “facial-predicting selection” would be used more frequently with female embryos, furthering the notion that a woman’s value is derived from her looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advocate for these technologies is likely to respond that these problems can be avoided if we simply make it so that everyone were genetically enhanced. This way, there would not be significant variation in disease or IQ or appearance, and therefore not much variation in life outcomes based on these things. Yet a more egalitarian approach would seek to minimise the differences that these features have on people’s lives at all, by changing societies’ institutions and structures so that life outcomes weren’t so dictated by these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, advocates might respond that it should be up to individuals alone if they wanted to make use of such technology, and many could choose the status quo and simply opt out. Yet the widespread introduction of these technologies would radically alter the status quo, and thus change the nature of the choice, from an exception to something that is seemingly ordinary and unobjectionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to consider who is driving this social change, and whether it is sufficiently democratic and representative. The scientists developing the technologies come from a small sub-section of society and may not be best placed to sympathise with or understand the concerns of those on the margins of society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, researchers are not always beholden to states for funding (which can influence what gets worked on). They often receive private capital. We need to consider whether it is right that a small number of unrepresentative, rich funders and scientists are able to implement technologies that have the ability to radically alter society in unprecedented ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political philosophers have long been concerned with this perceived injustice: that natural talents can have such a bearing on the kind of life one has. It is often argued that justice requires that we make amends for inequalities that result from factors such as health, IQ and appearance that individuals themselves cannot control. John Rawls, an American moral philosopher who passed away in 2002, argued that life is often a lottery; nature deals us a certain hand, regarding our genetics, talents and social circumstances. As these facets of our identity are ascribed by the luck of the draw, we cannot be said to deserve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Rawls, the fairest society would be one that any one of us would be happy to endorse if we did not know the hand that we were going to be dealt, how healthy or clever we were going to be. Such a society would be fair to all, no matter what these features of our identity were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the debate over genetic enhancement is the idea that some lives or traits are not as desirable—a view that would be reinforced by the state and its health industries. This affects how we all view each other, particularly those who may deviate from a new genetically-selected “norm”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eradicating serious genetic diseases in order to improve well-being is a noble pursuit, we should be wary of extending this reasoning to arguments for creating “enhanced” people. If well-being is dictated by traits such as beauty and IQ, we need to think seriously about whether this is as it should be, and work towards addressing the social conditions that allow this to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be far better for society to ensure that well-being doesn’t differ drastically amongst people of different IQ and income levels. This could be done by seeing that universal public services are up to scratch and enabling people to live rich, healthy lives regardless of their wealth. Advocates of genetic enhancement have seemingly identified an injustice: that traits such as intelligence enable people to live “better” lives. However, instead of locating this injustice in the institutional arrangements that allow such inequalities to flourish, supporters of genetic enhancement end up perpetuating the idea that it is acceptable for such differences to dictate outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would do well to remember that we are all only ever temporarily abled—each one of us is prone to illness and injury, and we all depend on others for care at some point in our lives. Retaining a more empathetic approach, predicated on the belief that every human life is valuable, is crucial for ensuring a well-functioning society that works for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;____________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gulzaar Barn is a postdoctoral research associate at King&amp;#x27;s College London.

Jonathan Cape; £14.99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIS NOVEL about people with layered or doubled lives has a suitably ambiguous title. Midhat Kamal, the faltering but sympathetic hero of Isabella Hammad’s debut, becomes known as the “Parisian”—in Arabic, &lt;em&gt;al-Barisi&lt;/em&gt;—after his return from years of study in France. Back home in Nablus, north of Jerusalem, Midhat must try to reconcile the free-thinking ideals fostered by his years in Montpellier and Paris with the duties of a son and heir. Custom and loyalty demand that he marry, sustain the family’s name, and prepare to run his father’s textile business. Meanwhile, his Muslim community is shaken by the first world war, the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the arrival of British Mandate rule in Palestine.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the first act of this lavish, leisurely and immersive novel, Midhat’s craving for intellectual freedom and “cosmopolitan life” finds a focus in his love for Jeannette, the daughter of his academic host in France. Predictably, prejudice and misunderstanding thwart their union. Throughout, Ms Hammad counts the psychic cost of the gulf between others’ views of Midhat and his own. Disoriented, in every sense, Midhat quits his medical studies. He accepts “an embrace of otherness” and drifts through the hedonism of postwar Paris, while flirting with the politics of Arab liberation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He travels back to the post-Ottoman Nablus of the 1920s with a “double view” and a divided soul. In that prosperous but faction-riven hotbed of “jealousy and scandal”, Midhat takes over his father’s shop and half-willingly marries the strong-minded Fatima, the daughter of an independence leader. Via a succession of scenes framed, paced and coloured with artistry, Ms Hammad entwines domestic intrigue with public strife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “fever of unity” slowly binds the Palestinian elite and the peasantry into a campaign against the injustice of the British Mandate. Despite the local backbiting, the riots and repressions, Midhat lets his dream of Europe fade. His home, and his clan, seems to suck him in, with its “webs of subtle comfort, of knowing and being known”. Yet he remains as profoundly torn as the “crossover figures” around him—above all, the mysterious French scholar-priest Père Antoine, another of this book’s uneasy chameleons. As strikes and protests escalate into the armed Arab revolt of 1936, Midhat’s secret self, with its “glamour of hiddenness”, bursts out of its carefully constructed social shell. His trauma mirrors the collective unrest of the times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised in London, now living in New York, Ms Hammad herself has family roots in Nablus (she has said that Midhat is based on her great-grandfather). Like its riven protagonist, her novel—an English-language epic steeped in Palestinian stories from almost a century ago—can feel tugged between two worlds. Midhat’s overlapping identities seem to him like “conflicting maps of the same place”. Similarly, Ms Hammad overlays a sophisticated, up-to-date grasp of the scars, overt and covert, left by unjust authority onto the traditional pleasures of the sprawling historical saga. Echoes from classic European fiction (Midhat reads Flaubert) mingle with a debt to the hybrid storytelling perfected, in Arabic, by the Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz—above all, in his great “Cairo Trilogy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Parisian” comes across as both old-fashioned and modern-minded. Despite a few dragging interludes, Ms Hammad’s command of the broad picture and the filigree detail alike makes this paradoxical tone succeed. One of Midhat’s French friends disdains the small stuff since he “was an architect, not a carpenter”. Ms Hammad knows, and triumphantly shows, that a novelist of vision must be both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 01:06:22 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[America defends freedom of conscience abroad]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/04/30/america-defends-freedom-of-conscience-abroad]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_BLP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-30T09:31:47Z&quot;&gt;Apr 30th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR SOME Americans, such as Vice-President Mike Pence, promoting religious liberty at home and opposing religious persecution round the world are parts of a single, inter-connected struggle. About a month ago, Mr Pence told cheering fellow conservatives that “freedom of religion is under attack in our country” and cited the criticism endured by his wife Karen for teaching at a Christian school where openly gay people are unwelcome. In other contexts, he has insisted that opposing religious oppression everywhere must be central to American diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others would say that the contentious issues bunched under “religious freedom” in domestic American debates (the role of contraception in employer-funded health plans, religiously inspired teaching in schools, and so on) are of a different order to the dreadful persecution that takes place in many parts of the world. On the first cluster of issues, reasonable folk might disagree; over the second, no decent person could fail to be horrified, and opposing such horrors (from blasphemy trials to re-education camps) must surely be a common American concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, though, even the global defence of freedom of conscience has become increasingly politicised. That shows up in the make-up of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a bipartisan agency constituted by Congress and the White House that is tasked to provide advice on persecution and how best to oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioners have tended to be distinguished academics or religious figures whose personal authority somewhat transcended politics. But things are more contentious now. The panel includes the former and current presidents of the Family Research Council, a conservative lobby group which declares that homosexuality is “harmful to those who engage in it” and denounces same-sex nuptials as a “radical redefinition and falsification of marriage”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those Republican stalwarts (respectively Gary Bauer and Tony Perkins), there are Democratic nominees. The USCIRF’s rotating chairmanship is now held by Tenzin Dorjee, a scholar of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism who was appointed to the panel by Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House. Another Democratic choice is Gayle Manchin, an educator and former First Lady of West Virginia, who is vice-chair of the panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diverse as they are, these people hold some things in common, and these include a healthy disrespect for the persecution of believers in communist and former communist lands. The USCIRF’s annual report, published this week, was harsher than ever in its denunciation of China, for its persecution of Muslims, Buddhists, Christians and other believers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the north-west of China, the report noted, Muslims were under constant surveillance, and subject for example to intrusive blood sampling, the confiscation of phones and a ban on sending children to the mosque. “Even worse, the Chinese government has ripped entire families apart, detaining between 800,000 and 2m adults in concentration camps and relegated some of their children to orphanages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mr Bauer put it, in any rating of severe religious oppressors, “China would be in a category all by itself...they are an equal opportunity persecutor. They go after anybody, any sect that might compete with the communist, atheistic government of China.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USCIRF commended the State Department for keeping China, along with nine other countries, on its list of “countries of particular concern” or egregious persecutors and it urged that six other countries, including Russia, be added to the list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has come under fire recently for its harsh persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses, scores of whom have been arrested, charged with “extremism” and in some cases tortured. Some pietistic forms of Islam, not known to advocate or practise violence, have also been proscribed in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USCIRF urged the administration to consider the possibility of sanctions against Saudi Arabia after 37 people, mostly from the Shia Muslim minority, were executed. Saudi Arabia features on every list of egregious persecutors but successive American administrations granted waivers that preclude punitive measures against the kingdom. On April 26th Mr Dorjee said the State Department must stop “giving a free pass” to the Saudis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However a Republican nominee to the commission, Johnnie Moore, insisted on April 29th that all was not ill in Saudi Arabia. “It’s a kingdom where there are lots of different things happening, some things that are the worst in the world, and [by] the same token there is a glimmer of light,” said Mr Moore, a member of group of evangelicals who support President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a gesture that some might see as mildly pro-Saudi, the Commission’s report proposed that the Houthis (enemies of the Saudi-led coalition fighting a cruel war in Yemen) be added to a list of “entities of particular concern”, in other words, non-state actors which practise religious persecution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where authoritarian regimes (and other cruel zealots such as lynch mobs and terrorists) seem ever more confident, many might wonder how much difference to anything can be made by manoeuvres on the inside track of American politics and diplomacy. For example, whatever anyone proposes, it seems very unlikely that America will ever impose sanctions against its Saudi allies because of religious persecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that America has elaborate machinery for the monitoring and advocacy of religious freedom, both by the USCIRF and the State Department, does serve a purpose. Whatever their ideological antecedents, and however little sympathy they might have for Islam, the staunch Republican conservatives who sit on the USCIRF are obliged ex officio to stand up for oppressed Muslims in China and, say, Myanmar; that is more than many Muslim governments do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As regards Russia, many American conservatives and evangelicals might be somewhat tempted by hints coming from high places in Moscow, including the state-guided media, that there should be a common Russian-American front, grouping traditionalists in both countries, against sexual and reproductive freedom, and in support of oppressed Christians in the Middle East. But through the USCIRF and its research, American non-conformists are brought face to face with the fact that Russia’s present rulers are no friends of dissident Christian sects or idiosyncratic religious groups. That sets sensible limits to any love affair between American and Russian religious conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:06:56 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advice from a dismal scientist to new parents]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/04/30/advice-from-a-dismal-scientist-to-new-parents]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_FND000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-30T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 30th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR NEW parents, it is a terrifying moment. The hospital doors close behind them, leaving them with a new and helpless human being. The baby’s survival into adulthood seems impossible. What if it will not eat? What if it is allergic to water? What if an owl carries it off? Probably, few parents wish at that moment for the help of an economist. But “Cribsheet”, a new book by Emily Oster of Brown University, shows that in the hectic haze of parenthood an economist’s perspective can prove surprisingly clarifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Oster’s academic work relates to health and health policy. A recent paper, for example, studied how food-purchasing decisions change in response to being diagnosed with diabetes. Five years ago she published a book on pregnancy, drawing on her training as an economist and her own experience (her husband, Jesse Shapiro, with whom she has two children, is also an economist at Brown). “Cribsheet” tackles the next step in the journey from childfree person to parent. Deciding whether to have a child in the first place fairly obviously involves economic calculations, from the impact on the parents’ earning potential to the resources that must be set aside to pay for nappies, child care and university. The decisions that come in a torrent after the birth, in contrast, such as whether to breastfeed or how to manage sleeping arrangements, might not seem so amenable to such thinking. But Ms Oster’s new book shows that they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents generally try to maximise the welfare, present and future, of their children (and, secondarily, themselves) subject to constraints of money and time. That requires choices. Economics can help a parent judge these trade-offs. Good choices begin with good information. Before deciding whether breastfeeding is worth the time, trouble and physical toll, it helps to know the benefits compared with feeding with formula. Parents do as most people do when making a hard call: turn to experts, friends, family and the internet. But different sources provide wildly different answers—and often with an extraordinary intensity of belief. As Ms Oster notes, internet mums frequently write as though ignoring their advice is tantamount to abandoning a child to wolves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The help she provides begins with sorting through published research and determining what is worth heeding. This involves more than identifying outright disinformation, of the sort published by anti-vaccination groups. The conclusions of serious research also need to be treated with care. Unless studies are well-designed, the results can be influenced by confounding factors. The purported benefits of breastfeeding, such as conferring a higher IQ on the child, can reflect the fact that women who are richer and better educated, and have higher IQs, are more likely to breastfeed. More reliable research attempts to take account of these factors. Whenever possible—and breastfeeding is a case where participants would almost certainly refuse to co-operate—researchers arrange randomised controlled trials, randomly dividing participants into “control” and “treatment” groups, only one of which engages in the behaviour under study, the better to isolate its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when a study is well designed, it can require statistical sophistication to understand the size of any effect and the significance of the result. Non-economists may find “Cribsheet” interesting as a guide to understanding research findings, though harried parents may focus more on its concrete guidance. There is plenty of this. Breastfeeding, it turns out, provides short-term health benefits to babies (notably by making diarrhoea less common) and reduces the mother’s risk of developing breast cancer. But there is no hard evidence that breastfed babies enjoy long-term health or cognitive benefits compared with bottlefed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, given the potential benefits, why not do it? Economic analyses include not only what is gained by a choice, but what is foregone. For example, putting an infant to sleep beside a parent in bed rather than alone in a cot is associated with a higher risk of sudden infant death. If there are no exacerbating factors (such as a mother who smokes or drinks), that increased risk is tiny: 22 deaths in 100,000, rather than eight. But why risk it? The answer may be that it is worth it. Sleeping side by side can make breastfeeding easier. More importantly, for some parents it is the only way to settle the baby (and hence to get some sleep themselves).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged sleep deprivation is horrible and makes it harder to be a good parent—or to function. Some mummy bloggers may find it unconscionable that a mother would expose her child to extra risks in order to treat herself to a few hours of sleep. Ms Oster suggests that, if well-informed parents make that choice, then it is reasonable: a welfare-enhancing balancing of benefits and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mother’s place is in the wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economic reasoning can feel bloodless. But the calculations in Ms Oster’s book seem more human than “Mummy War” moralising, in their recognition that parental time and energy are finite. She reckons it is helpful to think about work-life balance in bluntly economic terms: “What is the optimal configuration of adult work hours for your household?” In the past, male economists like Gary Becker used such logic to argue that women should “specialise” in home-making. But Ms Oster points out that the benefits to a household of more income (often a necessity) should not be ignored—and neither should a mother’s preferences. Although research suggests that policies allowing a parent to stay home in an infant’s first months do benefit children, staying home for two years rather than one does not meaningfully alter a child’s prospects. Women who need or want to return to work should not be kept from doing so by guilt or others’ expectations, she writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenting can be fraught. “Cribsheet” aims to help parents do better. And in capturing how they struggle when beset by dubious information and emotional pressure from peers, it also holds lessons for economists. Welfare-maximising decisions are hard to make, and sometimes people need a little help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:06:55 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bret Easton Ellis is wrong about millennial reading habits]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/04/30/bret-easton-ellis-is-wrong-about-millennial-reading-habits]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_BKP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-30T15:41:35Z&quot;&gt;Apr 30th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHAT IS millennial culture?” Bret Easton Ellis asked in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-interview-american-psycho-author-bret-easton-ellis-on-why-he-hates-millennials-0zngpx6pq&quot;&gt;a recent interview with the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of London. “There’s no writing. They don’t care about literature. None of them read books.” He went on: “Where is the great millennial novel? There isn’t one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Ellis, the so-called “bad boy of American literature”, was at his zenith in the 1980s and ‘90s when he published novels such as “Less Than Zero” and “American Psycho”. “White”, a work of nonfiction, is his first book in nearly a decade. It is advertised as an “admonishment of received truths”; mostly it is a screed on what he calls “Generation Wuss”. His main source on the subject appears to be his younger boyfriend, Todd, and Todd’s friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The millennial Mr Ellis conjures is already familiar from newspaper thinkpieces. She eats $8 avocado toast and drinks $5 lattes, while her parents pay her rent and her therapy bills. She scrolls listlessly through social media, occasionally allowing herself to be outraged by opinions she does not agree with. She measures her worth in likes, and has not picked up a book since college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facts rather complicate this picture, not least when it comes to who millennials actually are. The youngest, born in the early 2000s, are just entering college and cannot legally drink beer in America. Others are pushing 40, and likely have families of their own and no interest in social media whatsoever. While the term is handy for curmudgeons, “millennial” encompasses a wide range of ages and experiences, as the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; style guide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://blogs.wsj.com/styleandsubstance/2017/12/04/vol-30-no-11-millennials/&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; when cautioning against the overuse of the term in the paper’s pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190504_WOC111.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190504_WOC111.png 200w,

Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/08/nearly-one-in-five-americans-now-listen-to-audiobooks/&quot;&gt;conducted a study&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that found that 84% of 18- to 29-year-olds in America had read or listened to a book in some format in the past year (see chart). Of 30- to 49-year-olds, 74% had done so; for  50- to 64-year-olds the figure was 71%. Adults aged 65 and older were the least interested in the written word. Such details are inconvenient for the standard caricature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myth of millennials’ neglect of culture persists not because it is true or useful, but because it serves the interests of someone like Mr Ellis, who has built his career on provocation. In the past he has acknowledged that he has young readers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=571852&quot;&gt;in an interview from 2005&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Ellis said that he gets fan mail about “Less Than Zero” (1985) “from people who weren’t really born yet when the book came out”. Yet perhaps the most telling moment in the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; piece is when Decca Aitkenhead, the interviewer, asks him if he’s read Sally Rooney, the author of the novels “Conversations with Friends” and “Normal People”, which was nominated for the Man Booker prize. Ms Rooney, who was born in 1991, is often hailed—and assailed—as “first great millennial novelist”. Mr Ellis says: “Er, remind me who Sally Rooney is?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While deriding millennials for not reading, Mr Ellis reveals that he hasn’t read much of their writing, either. Ms Aitkenhead points out that he also hasn’t bothered with “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/09/27/the-real-victims-of-campus-activism-are-the-students&quot;&gt;The Coddling of the American Mind&lt;/a&gt;”, Greg Lukianoff’s and Jonathan Haidt’s popular treatise, and “to have written a book about the mindset of millennials without bothering to consult this...seems a remarkable omission”. Ross Douthat, a columnist for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, recently made a similar comment about the absence of generational novel. What they both actually seem to be saying is that they haven’t read a great millennial novel, and because they are tastemakers, it follows that there isn’t one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is no “Great Novel” for this generation it may well be because the generational novel was always a myth. There is something to be gained by eschewing the idea of the “Great Millennial Novel” altogether: it encourages reading variously and widely, rather than seeking a particular voice to fit a stereotype. That, incidentally, is what millennials are already doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:06:42 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
