In Anton Chekhov’s plays no prop is without symbolic weight, and the broken clock is a particularly rich (if unsubtle) symbol: a rupture with times past. In a new adaptation at the Almeida theatre in London, the broken clock also signifies a different kind of anachronism. Here, the &lt;em&gt;fin-de-siècle&lt;/em&gt; listlessness of Chekhov’s play is partially relocated to the present. The characters speak in a contemporary vernacular, but they exchange traditional Russian silverware and dream of a future in which “women will wear trousers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim, presumably, is to emphasise the connections between Chekhov’s time and the 21st century, and the play does have much to say to angst-ridden millennials. The young protagonists are struggling to carve out a personal and political role for themselves. They are talked down to by an older generation that dismisses their concerns as unserious and narcissistic (as Cordelia Lynn, who has written the adaptation, said in an interview: “What does that remind you of?”) Chekhov’s plot centres on the attempts of the titular siblings to work, marry or adulterate their way out of a rural backwater, where they moved from their longed-for Moscow home. When a military garrison arrives in town, bringing with it the glamorous Lieutenant-Colonel Vershinin (Peter McDonald) and Baron Tuzenbach (Shubham Saraf), the sisters see an escape route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearl Chanda, Patsy Ferran and Ria Zmitrowicz give accomplished performances as Masha, Olga and Irina Sergeyevna respectively. As the girls’ lives wear on, their ambitions are thwarted. Masha’s acid tongue and intellectual conviction give way to melancholy and malaise, even as she pursues a love affair with Vershinin. Irina’s enthusiasm for work is ground down by the mundane reality of jobs in the telegraph office and local council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odd sibling out is brother Andrey, played with despondency by Freddie Meredith. Unlike his sisters, he marries for love, to local girl Natasha Ivanovna (Lois Chimimba). But he, too, ends up desperately unhappy, abandoning his dreams of academia as his gambling addiction, his children and his unfaithful wife consume his life. As Olga, Ms Ferran has the slighter part, perhaps surprisingly given her award-winning turn in Ms Frecknall’s last Almeida production, Tennesee Williams’s “Summer and Smoke”. In that play, every scene ratchets up the tension like a coiled spring. The Chekhov is an altogether different affair: images and plotlines spark in different directions, before darkening to ash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The play works best when the pace is quick. In the first act, before the confessional speechifying gets properly underway, each scene moves energetically into the next, with most of the cast onstage. The third act injects another shot of energy, when a fire breaks out in the village. For the most part, however, the play is unavoidably cumbersome. Even as the production plays up the Beckettian verbosity, some absurdity remains. At the interval, one Almeida dramaturge commented that, had the text arrived on his desk from a new writer, he would have reached quickly for the red pen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is a thought-provoking interpretation of the material. In the production’s boldest anachronism, Chebutykin quotes T.S Eliot’s “Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock”. The poem was written 15 years after Chekhov’s death, but it is a startling prism through which to view “Three Sisters”, itself a linguistic and structural patchwork. The characters miserably measure out their lives, in coffee spoons, shot glasses or baby bottles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the great risk of staging a play about crushing ennui and profound dissatisfaction is the possibility of instilling those feelings in the audience. Despite the three-hour running time, a consistently strong cast helps this production to avoid that pitfall—narrowly. No easy answers are granted to the audience any more than to the characters. The protagonists try to escape, to advance or to return. All end up nightmarishly stuck, like the hands of a broken clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Three Sisters” is at the Almeida until June 1st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:06:27 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, is running for president in Taiwan]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/17/terry-gou-the-founder-of-foxconn-is-running-for-president-in-taiwan]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_ASP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AT A TEMPLE festooned with red lanterns, Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, declared that Mazu, the sea goddess, had recently appeared to him in a dream. “Mazu told me to come out and do something,” he recounted after lighting some incense. Thus did the tycoon announce that he had decided to run for president. Mazu, he insisted, also urged him to seek peace with China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr Gou’s firm makes iPhones for Apple, among other things. His decision to seek the nomination of the Kuomintang party (KMT), Taiwan’s main opposition party, for the presidential election in January, has caused a sensation on the island-state. His wealth and fame instantly make him a strong contender. But his close ties to China will alarm many, since China considers Taiwan part of its territory, and is always looking for ways to undermine Taiwan’s government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent president, already confronted an uphill battle in her campaign for re-election. Her approval ratings are low. She faces a challenger for the nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the form of her former prime minister, Lai Ching-te. Mr Lai is more popular than Ms Tsai, which is especially troubling for the president since the DPP will pick as its nominee the candidate who performs best in a national opinion poll to be conducted in late May or early June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr Gou has a good chance to secure the nomination of the KMT, which will pick a candidate based largely on an opinion poll, like the DPP, but also with some input from a vote of the party’s members. The two other declared candidates, Eric Chu, a former mayor of New Taipei City, and Wang Jin-pyng, a former speaker of parliament, are not as famous as Mr Gou. The more formidable Han Kuo-yu, the mayor of Taiwan’s second-biggest city, Kaohsiung, may yet throw his hat in the ring—although he may also be put off by Mr Gou’s unexpected candidacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Either way, Mr Gou will doubtless try to sell himself as an ordinary Taiwanese made good—hence his folksy visit to the temple in the gritty suburbs of Taipei. He founded Foxconn with a small loan, and built it into the world’s biggest contract manufacturer for big electronics brands. Given that voters are concerned above all with the weakness of the Taiwanese economy, his business acumen will be a big selling point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But in another sense, Mr Gou’s business empire will be a liability. Most of Foxconn’s factories are in China. That gives the Chinese government huge leverage over him. It is hard to see how Mr Gou can escape from the glaring conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lots of Taiwanese own businesses in China, and around 1m of them work there, out of a total population of 24m. The KMT favours warmer ties with China, and still upholds the idea that the two countries will one day be reunified. The DPP, in contrast, considers Taiwan a completely distinct country, and would like the world to treat it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Since the DPP won both the presidency and a majority in parliament in 2016, China has called a halt to all high-level contacts between the two countries and choked off the flow of Chinese package tourists to Taiwan. It has also tried to win over the few countries that still have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and regularly deploys warships and fighter jets dangerously close to the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr Gou could probably put a stop to this intimidation with a more emollient approach were he to become president. But many Taiwanese would inevitably be asking themselves what the hidden costs might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:06:26 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alan García, Peru’s ex-president, kills himself before being arrested]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/17/alan-garcia-perus-ex-president-kills-himself-before-being-arrested]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_AMP502_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ON THE evening of April 16th, Alan García, Peru’s former president, went on the radio to declare he was innocent of accusations of corruption that were swirling around. Rumours of his likely arrest were pure supposition, he insisted: “I can tell you that I was not born to steal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when police officers went to his home in Lima the next morning to detain him, Mr García asked to make a phone call, went into a room and closed the door, according to the interior minister, Carlos Morán. Minutes later, a shot rang out, and police found Mr García sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head. He died a few hours later in a hospital. Mr García perished as he had lived as a politician—surrounded by controversy.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;He was one of several senior figures caught up in a corruption case that is convulsing Peruvian political life; two other presidents are either in detention or have served time in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The scandal stems from the Lava Jato (“Car Wash”) investigation in Brazil, which has spread to other countries. Brazilian prosecutors have won convictions for 155 people, and prison sentences totalling more than 2,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One major part of the investigation concerns Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company, which has been found to have paid billions of dollars in bribes to politicians across Latin America in exchange for lucrative contracts. In Peru more than a dozen politicians, including Mr García, have been implicated since 2016. Last November, prosecutors barred him from leaving the country for 18 months while he was investigated in several Odebrecht-linked cases, particularly allegations of taking bribes in 2008 in connection with the construction of the metro in Lima. He sought asylum in the Uruguayan embassy in Lima, which was denied. In April, details of corruption involving his confidants started to leak; senior Odebrecht officials were set to testify next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García’s first term in office, from 1985 to 1990, was marked by disastrous populist policies. In 1989, inflation rocketed above 7,000% and economic output shrank by 12%. But his second term, from 2006 to 2011, went much better. A free-trade agreement with the United States set the stage for subsequent deals with China, the European Union and a number of other countries. Average economic growth was impressive, at about 7% per year, and inflation and unemployment remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Although he oversaw strong economic growth, Mr García’s terms were marked by allegations of graft. Two years after the first ended in 1990 he went into exile in Colombia, living between there and France for eight years to avoid prosecution. He returned to make a remarkable political comeback after the statute of limitations had run out in 2001, and won an election in 2006. After his second term ended in 2011, he was again investigated, only to be let off the hook on technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Lava Jato investigation was too extensive to escape, however. It has exposed the corruption and incompetence at the heart of Peruvian politics. Prosecutors have asked the United States to extradite Alejandro Toledo, Mr García’s predecessor, who stands accused of accepting a $20m bribe from Odebrecht (he denies the allegation). Both of Mr García’s successors are also implicated: Ollanta Humala spent nearly nine months in prison. He was released a year ago this month, pending trial for allegedly receiving $3m in undeclared campaign funds from the construction giant. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was detained on April 10th on similar charges, but was then taken to hospital suffering from high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Odebrecht net has also ensnared Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the conservative Popular Force party and daughter of a former president, Alberto Fujimori. Both are sitting in prison. She is there for allegedly accepting a $1m campaign contribution from Odebrecht. Her father was convicted of violating human rights during his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García may have ended his torment. But the consequences of the Odebrecht scandal will be felt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 08:08:50 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alberta’s new premier plans to abolish the carbon tax]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/17/albertas-new-premier-plans-to-abolish-the-carbon-tax]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_AMP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HELP IS on the way, and hope is on the horizon,” proclaimed Jason Kenney after his United Conservative Party decisively won the election in Alberta, an oil-producing province in western Canada, on April 16th. He was talking to Albertans depressed by a downturn in the oil industry, which has pushed up unemployment and left empty a quarter of the office space in Calgary, the province’s biggest city. For Justin Trudeau, Canada’s Liberal prime minister, Mr Kenney’s victory is more a source of worry than of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Alberta’s slump was largely caused by factors beyond the province’s control—notably the fall in oil prices in 2014-15—voters took their anger out on the government of Rachel Notley of the left-leaning New Democratic Party. Her election four years ago had been a first for a province with a reputation for Texas-like conservatism and suspicion of the federal authorities in Ottawa. Ms Notley is a defender of the province’s oil industry, which extracts the stuff expensively from tar sands. She lobbied hard for an expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline to take more oil to the Pacific coast for export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she is also an environmentalist, and introduced a carbon tax, now C$30 ($22) a tonne, to discourage greenhouse-gas emissions. In striking this balance she had an ally in Mr Trudeau, who championed the pipeline but also passed a law requiring provinces to set a price on carbon emissions or to submit to one imposed by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Canada has resisted that grand bargain. The province of British Columbia, the pipeline’s terminus, remains opposed to the project on environmental grounds. In August 2018 the federal government took it over from Kinder Morgan, the frustrated US-based firm trying to build it. Moreover, four provinces led by conservative premiers—Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick—are fighting Mr Trudeau’s carbon price in the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta will now join them. Mr Kenney, a former federal immigration minister described by Maclean’s, a magazine, as a “Guinness-sipping nerd”, is expected swiftly to kill the provincial carbon tax. He plans to raise an emissions cap on tar sands oil production and slow down plans to eliminate coal-fired electricity. He has threatened to cut off British Columbia from shipments of Alberta’s oil if it continues to oppose the pipeline expansion. Mr Kenney also promises to bring “tens of thousands of jobs” to Alberta by slashing environmental and labour regulation, and by reducing the corporate-tax rate from 12% to 8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, his victory will pose additional problems for Mr Trudeau, who has been hurt by allegations that his office put improper pressure on the country’s attorney-general to drop the prosecution of a Quebec-based engineering company. He faces a re-election battle in October. But Mr Trudeau may not mind a fight over climate policy. According to a poll conducted in March by Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians say climate change is one of the top five issues they will consider when they vote. Just 28% of Canadians are firmly opposed to a carbon tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government has the power to override British Columbia’s opposition to the pipeline expansion. It could do so as early as May 22nd. That gives Mr Trudeau some hope that he can rescue his energy grand bargain, despite Mr Kenney’s opposition to the carbon tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta’s new premier may benefit from an upturn in the province’s growth. The unemployment rate was 6.9% in March. That is still 1.1 percentage points above the national rate, but it is well below the peak of 9.1% in November 2016. TD Financial Group, a bank, predicts that Alberta’s economy will grow by 2.4% in real terms next year, the fastest rate in the country, thanks in part to a rise in oil prices. The sunnier outlook has nothing to do with the new premier’s pro-oil policies. That will not stop him from taking the credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 04:10:38 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Indonesia’s president wins a second term]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/17/indonesias-president-wins-a-second-term]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_ASP503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE RESULTS was never really in doubt. On April 17th, just hours after polling stations closed, pollsters released preliminary estimates showing that Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo (better known as Jokowi) had won a second term in office. He is thought to have clinched about 55% of the vote, against 45% for his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, a former general. The contest was a replay of the previous race, in 2014, which Jokowi won by a slightly narrower margin. On April 18th the election commission will announce the preliminary result, before an official, certified outcome to be released in May. Its numbers may differ fractionally from those of the pollsters, but the outcome will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters&amp;#x27; enduring support for Jokowi can be partly explained by his sensible policies. Outside a polling station in a village near Jakarta, Suyagina, a housewife, says it is now much easier for her to buy medicines thanks to Jokowi&amp;#x27;s expansion of health-insurance coverage. Rachman, a middle-aged voter sporting enormous sunglasses and a crisp white shirt, says the president’s much-needed investment in infrastructure has helped, too. And Jokowi has managed the economy reasonably well, keeping inflation low and growth solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jokowi&amp;#x27;s likely victory is also thanks to cynical politicking. One weakness of his previous campaign was a perceived lack of piety, which put off some voters. Rumours circulating on social media claimed that he was a closet Christian—a potential handicap in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. This time Jokowi shielded himself from such accusations by picking a hardline Muslim cleric, Ma&amp;#x27;ruf Amin, as his running-mate. The vice-president-elect wants the country to adopt Islamic law and is keen to ban homosexual acts as well as some Muslim sects he considers heretical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jokowi has also cosied up to the army to counter Mr Prabowo’s nationalism. He has peppered his inner circle with retired generals and is considering reserving some jobs in the civil service jobs for soldiers. In the fashion of Indonesia’s former strongmen, he has used the police, prosecutors and bureaucrats to make life difficult for his most vocal opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite Jokowi’s use of such underhand tactics, his victory still looks likely to be smaller than expected. He was hoping to claim over 60% of the vote—the tally with which his predecessor was re-elected. Opinion polls before the election had given him a 20-percentage-point lead. Experts put the disappointing showing partly down to Mr Prabowo&amp;#x27;s strong electoral machine, which helped to turn out wavering supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Mr Prabowo will respond to another defeat is unclear. In 2014 he cried foul and challenged the result in the constitutional court. He also encouraged his supporters to take to the streets. That could happen again. He has already claimed that his own party&amp;#x27;s tally shows him to be the true victor, a finding which is entirely at odds with that of most pollsters. At a press conference outside his house in Jakarta he told supporters to guard ballot boxes, implying that the other side had cheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Mr Prabowo’s supporters do protest against the result, that would blight a well-run election. Coordinating balloting for 187m registered voters across a rugged and sprawling archipelago of 17,000 islands is no small feat. Yet voting mostly went smoothly and participants seemed glad of the chance to take part. The biggest source of disruption was confusion over the long list of candidates. Voters were not only picking a president, but a national legislature and provincial, local and municipal assemblies too. That meant many voters had to wrestle with five different ballot papers, some of which were the size of a poster, with hundreds of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of races other than the presidential one are still trickling in. It looks as though the make-up of the national parliament will remain much the same. The victors of local battles could take some time to be declared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data also suggest that turnout has jumped by about five percentage points since the 2014 election, to around 80%. That would make it the biggest election ever conducted in a single day, anywhere. That is probably thanks to a concerted campaign to turn out the vote by politicians on both sides. Businesses joined in the effort. Hundreds of them, from cinemas to sushi restaurants, offered discounts to those who had voted and could prove it with an ink-stained finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high turnout may be one of the few things about the election that pleases Jokowi. Both he and his party, PDI-P, fared worse than expected. A heftier victory would have allowed him to sideline his conservative vice-president and the armed forces. And had PDI-P claimed more seats it would have been able to reduce its reliance on its five coalition partners. Jokowi has made compromises to ensure re-election, but failed to consolidate his power as a result. Those compromises may haunt him in his second term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 04:10:37 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI powers Amazon]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/17/how-ai-powers-amazon]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/babbage_9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T19:02:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMAZON’S USE of artificial intelligence has long outstripped Facebook’s and Google’s.

To former politicians it was “stubborn” and “vindictive”. On April 17th New Zealand’s Labour Party succumbed to such pressure and abandoned plans to impose a contentious capital-gains tax on investment properties, shares and business assets. “While I have believed in a CGT, it’s clear many New Zealanders do not,” said Jacinda Ardern, a prime minister more accustomed to applause than defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an embarrassing climbdown for her party, which has campaigned for a capital-gains tax for almost a decade. Practically every other rich country has one. In February a government-appointed advisory group concluded that instituting one would make New Zealand’s tax system fairer, and recommended taxing capital gains at the same rate as the highest incomes. But Labour governs in a coalition with a populist party, New Zealand First. It courts older, rural voters who tend to oppose the levy, and refused to wave it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Ardern’s party has been stung by the policy before. It campaigned for a capital-gains tax at general elections in 2011 and 2014, and was trounced on both occasions. Polls had shown that a strong majority of New Zealanders still opposed the reform. Yet only about 10% of them would have been affected by a capital-gains tax at all, says Michael Littlewood, of Auckland Law School. And the advisory group had suggested sweetening the pill by using the revenue the tax brought in to lower income taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates of the tax hoped it would deter Kiwis from stashing their cash into bricks and mortar and thus cool overheated property prices. The government’s advisory group said it would help reduce the tax system’s coddling of the richest New Zealanders. The country has no stamp duty, or tax on land, estates or inheritance. The wealthy benefit disproportionately from income from property and other investments. As elsewhere, many think it unfair that profits from those assets are taxed lightly or not at all, while those who work for a living must surrender a big chunk of their income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses, however, were incensed by the advisory group’s proposals. They complained about being “double taxed” on profits from their operations, and on gains when their assets are sold. Opponents argued the tax would have deterred locals from saving for retirement, scared off investors, reduced job growth and driven up the costs of rental accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s reliance on agriculture proved another sticking point. Many of its farmers tolerate low incomes knowing that the value of their land will rise over time. They worried that a capital-gains tax would rob them of the opportunity to cash in when they sell their businesses. “Taking that away from them is a bit like taking away subsidies,” admits Michael Cullen, a former Labour finance minister who led the advisory group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Ardern promises not to revive the idea for as long as she is prime minister, meaning that Labour will not renew its campaign for the tax at next year’s election. The opposition National Party will be sad to lose a talking point. The government has wasted millions of dollars on a pointless review, and upset businesses in the process, complains its leader, Simon Bridges. “New Zealanders can’t trust Labour on tax,” he tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 23:06:17 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
