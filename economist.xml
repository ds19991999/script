Soulless corporations pollute the planet, overpay their bosses and gouge consumers. Big tech turns us into screen addicts. Big Pharma makes life-saving drugs unaffordable. Big banks sell us dodgy mortgages. One cannot help wondering, listening to the chatter on social media, whether corporations ever do anything right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, they do, says Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University in Virginia. In his latest book “Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero,” he argues that many of the gripes about business are ill-informed. And where there are real concerns, such as fraud or excessive concentrations of power, he believes that wise regulation can minimise the harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Cowen has earned a reputation as a shrewd and iconoclastic thinker. In his blog Marginal Revolution he relishes debunking junk economics with data. &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future initiative is publishing an excerpt from “Big Business” that presents the arc of his argument. We probe it further in a short interview that follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*       *      *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190525_opp504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190525_opp504.jpg 200w,

Among Democrats, for instance, the word “socialism” now polls better than does “capitalism.” But Republicans, while they pay greater lip service to some business ideals, are not in practice much better. Many of them have quite readily followed President Donald Trump into his attacks on free trade, immigration, outsourcing, and the American media (which is labeled “the enemy of the people”)—all fundamentally anti-business stances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business, quite simply, has become underrated, and thus I am writing a contrarian book that ought not to be contrarian at all. All of the criticisms one might mount against the corporate form—some of which are valid—pale in contrast to two straightforward and indeed essential virtues. First, business makes most of the stuff we enjoy and consume. Second, business is what gives most of us jobs. The two words that follow most immediately from the world of business are “prosperity” and “opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without business we would not have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ships, trains, and cars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Electricity, lighting, and heating equipment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Most of our food supply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Most of our lifesaving pharmaceuticals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Clothes for our children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Our telephones and smartphones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The books we love to read&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The ability to access, more or less immediately, so much of the world’s online information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget your paycheck. “Meeting payroll,” to invoke a now old-fashioned phrase, is nothing less than a heroic act. Someone or some group put in the hard work and thought up the innovations required to create a company from scratch—I know it’s easy enough to take this for granted if you aren’t the one who did it. On top of the paycheck, jobs are among our biggest sources of pride and a significant way to meet friends and establish social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can all admit that we are a nation sorely in need of virtue, specifically in our political realm. The growing polarization of today’s politics has made our government at best hopelessly sclerotic and at worst prone to unpredictable lurches. This polarization has also spurred out-of-control political correctness and censorship, rampant racism and injustice, new waves of violent marches and shootings, and an array of indictments and corruption charges. Many features of contemporary America are wonderful, including the high level of trust in the corporate sector, but the weirdness in our government has been rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the world of American business has never been more productive, more tolerant, and more cooperative. It is not just a source of GDP and prosperity; it is a ray of normalcy and predictability in its steady focus on producing what can be profitably sold to customers. Successful businesses grow dynamically, but they also try to create oases of stability and tolerance in which they can perfect their production methods. These oases help to attract and retain talent and make it possible for businesses to offer consumers a steady stream of “comfort products.” Business helps carve out spaces for love, friendship, creativity, and human caring by producing the resources that make our lives not just tolerable but comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American big business in particular has led the way toward making America more socially inclusive. McDonald’s, General Electric, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, and many of the major tech companies, among others, were defining health and other legal benefits for same-sex partners before the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft, Deutsche Bank, PayPal, and Marriott, among others, spoke out or protested the North Carolina law that sought to specify which restrooms transgender people had to use; the outcry led to the eventual repeal of that law. This push for tolerance shouldn’t come as any surprise. Big business has lots of customers and relies on the value of brand names. It doesn’t want any group of those customers to feel put out or discriminated against or to have cause for complaint, not least because we live in an age of social media. Profit maximization alone—not to mention the consciences of some CEOs—puts big business these days on the side of inclusion and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger firms, in particular, which you can think of as wildly successful businesses and thus embodiments of the logic of business, tend to be more tolerant of employee personal tastes than smaller firms. A local baker might be reluctant to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, but Sara Lee, which tries to build very broadly based national markets for its products, is happy to sell to all. The bigger companies need to protect their broader reputations and recruit large numbers of talented workers, including those from minority groups. They can’t survive and grow just by cultivating a few narrow networks of local white men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a complaint about America today, and it is simple: we don’t love business enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m here to speak up for business, to persuade you that it deserves more of your love and less hate. Perhaps, like you, I am not entirely comfortable with ceding so much of the daily human realm to apparently selfish, profit-maximizing, and even sometimes corrupt entities, but on closer examination this is a better bargain than it might seem at first. Indeed, at its best, business gives our lives more scope for the heroic and the noble, as we can use the outputs of business to satisfy our own creative desires and to better our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll argue that a lot of the most common criticisms of American business don’t stand up to scrutiny. For instance, it’s often claimed that American business is too focused on quarterly earnings statements, at the expense of a longer-run perspective. But in fact there is plenty of evidence that companies can think long-term when appropriate. Sometimes short-run problems are easier or more important to solve, or they are the bridge to longer-run success, and the evidence at hand indicates that American business does a pretty good job of looking to the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the question of American CEO pay, which Edward Luce, a Financial Times columnist (and a friend of mine), described on Twitter as “unconscionable.” American CEOs are paid much more than they used to be, but these pay hikes have pretty much moved in tandem with the size and valuations of the firms they manage. Contrary to common claims, it is hard to establish that CEOs as a whole are ripping off their shareholders with manipulated pay packages, as a look at the numbers will show that high compensation is the price of attracting top talent. Running a large corporation involves taking on more roles than ever before, including media, government, and public relations, formulating a vision, understanding consumers and communicating to them, building cross-cultural global strategies, working with governments, and keeping the company out of trouble, in addition to having a lot of sector-specific expertise. That limits the number of eligible candidates who might succeed at the job and thus it boosts their pay, according to basic principles of supply and demand. Today’s CEOs are literally superachievers, and it should come as no surprise that they are compensated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most frequently cited whipping boys is the financial sector, which is portrayed as too large and out of control. The reality is that the financial sector has held to a fairly constant 2 percent share of American wealth, though of course that wealth has grown and so has finance with it. The ability of American finance to mobilize savings into riskier forms of equity and venture capital has brought Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in value each year, and those gains significantly outweigh the costs typically attributed to the financial sector. Nor is the financial sector draining the American economy of all its talent for other endeavors, as evidenced by the rise of American manufacturing output to ever higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all, business is criticized for being fraudulent and ripping us off. While there is plenty of fraud in business, the commercial sector isn’t any more fraudulent than individuals in other capacities, and it may even be somewhat less fraudulent. Business can make us better people—for example, by teaching us how to cooperate better—and the best evidence indicates that, on net, businesses do not make us worse compared with our participation in other institutions. A lot of us were somewhat dishonest to begin with, and if you have doubts, just look at the individual lies and misrepresentations in online dating profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many of the problems with business are in fact problems with us, and they reflect the underlying and fairly universal imperfections of human nature. Yet we respond to this truth somewhat irrationally. While we suspect business of wrongdoing, at the same time we expect corporations to give us jobs and take care of us, to give us a network of friends, to solve our social problems, and to give us risk-free consumption experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly now in the age of social media, which allows direct connections with consumers and offers them the chance to provide direct feedback when things go wrong, the most successful businesses have a kind of messianic view of their role in society—venerating the delivery of goods and services to the consumer, or perhaps promoting a particular vision of how society ought to be. Workers wish to believe their toil is saving the environment, fighting poverty, and strengthening America as a nation. A business that instills in its workers and managers a sincere belief in such goals has a better chance of building a durable competitive advantage than a business that does not. It will attract more consumer loyalty and better and more cooperative partners at the business-to-business level. Think of it this way: Who wants to marry someone who is always selfishly seeking to optimize happiness from the marriage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand showed a deep insight into the character of successful business when she emphasized that it can be a vehicle for the achievement of heroic goals. The character of Hank Rearden in Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged stressed the dignity, honor, and reason involved in good productive work, and he came to see it as the very foundation of America’s greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often those business leaders who are religious or have strong ideologies of another kind who grasp most clearly the relevance of a business having a mission above and beyond profit. They understand that the business and religious or ideological sides of their lives are by no means totally separate. They understand they can do best by their shareholders—and the broader society—by tying together the business, religious, ethical, and ideological perspectives in one bundle. […]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, business at its best is a fundamentally ethical enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;__________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excerpted from “Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero” by Tyler Cowen.

For most goods and services, Americans have far more choice, choice of supplier and diversity of product than ever before. Consumers know this intuitively and it has turned out that recent claims about increased concentration in the American economy are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w25066.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largely wrong&lt;/a&gt; on a factual basis. In most sectors there is more actual competition, and the dominant players we do have, such as Amazon and Walmart, typically are lowering rather than raising prices when they enter markets. For the tech sector, there are dominant product suppliers such as Google and Facebook, but they are hardly following the old monopolist playbook of higher prices and restricted output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is too much concentration in the hospital sector, and in K-12 education: it’s a government semi-monopoly, and it’s hard to compete with the free government product unless you are selling to wealthy families. We also have some outrageously high prices for real estate and higher education, but those are due to supply constraints and excess regulation, rather than private monopoly. In all of these cases I would consider legal remedies to give consumers a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you fear most about the effects of the anti-business sentiment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; For a start, I fear we will split up our big tech companies, or at the very least severely distract senior management with antitrust suits. An alternative route we might go down is to enact severe privacy legislation which raises costs to new market entrants, and cements in the power of the incumbents. Either of those two paths would be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most generally, I fear that the status of going into business will fall, as it already has in much of Europe. It would hurt America greatly to lose its genius and distinct preference for business activity. Culture really does matter, and America stands at risk of losing its pro-business, pro-entrepreneurship leanings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; What do businesses need to do to improve their image, other than PR?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; Business has to realise it always will be held to a higher standard, perhaps unjustly so, but still that is a reality. That means business ought to opt for less fraud, less lobbying for crony capitalism, more social conscience when it comes to pollution and climate change, and also bolder, less bureaucratic decision-making procedures. We are pretty far from that world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stress in the book, a lot of business is pretty fraudulent. The thing is, human beings are fraudulent too; maybe more so outside of a business context. Ask a simple question: who lies more, the company Match.com, or the online daters filling out their profiles? The answer is both obvious and sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; What can individuals and groups do to hold businesses to account?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; Search for the best price; it benefits the whole market. Speak up when you are unhappy, noting that the internet makes the monitoring of business quality easier than ever before. When it comes to health care, educate yourself. So much of the waste in the American economy is in that sector. And, if you really see persistent business failures in a particular area, consider starting a business yourself to fix them. Or recommend the business idea to someone else. All of the best businesses today were at some point in the past unrealised dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; If we can&amp;#x27;t look to the political sphere for leadership to address global challenges, are we right to turn to business for that leadership? Ought they to rise to that mission, even if it strays from their central remit of making and selling their widgets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the biggest global challenges will require contributions from both government and business. Take climate change. Yes, governments need to regulate more and tax carbon emissions. But we also need businesses to step up and innovate. We’re seeing a systematic tendency to villainise the role of business in carbon emissions and pollution. Yes, business has had a major role in this, but so have consumers, so have voters, so have all of us. The reality is that we will need the help of business to solve the problem, and we should not make this a question of us versus them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 03:41:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The race to become Britain’s next PM]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/24/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190518_woc777.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;

In 2007 Hu Jintao, its leader at the time, announced to a congress of the Communist Party that acquiring soft power, or ruan shili, was essential for the country to become a global force. Xi Jinping, who succeeded Mr Hu in 2012, has zealously continued his mission to expand China’s cultural appeal as quickly as its economic heft and military strength. Today the party spends about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/china/2017/03/23/china-is-spending-billions-to-make-the-world-love-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$10bn a year on soft power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its most notable strategy has been to build Confucius Institutes on foreign university campuses. These offer instruction in Mandarin, cooking and dancing, among other cultural pursuits. According to Joshua Nederhood of Development Reimagined, a consultancy based in Beijing, the party has opened more than 500 of these institutes in the past 15 years, along with nearly 1,200 Confucius Classrooms, which offer language courses at schools. This rapid growth means that China, which had almost no foreign cultural outposts in 2000, now has more than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get our daily newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor&amp;#x27;s Picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; required=&quot;&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email address&quot;  aria-label=&quot;Subscription mail&quot;/&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Sign up now&quot; /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_WOC089.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190525_WOC089.png 200w,

Since 2006 Gallup, a pollster, has asked people around the globe whether they approve or disapprove of China’s leadership. The Economist has looked at the annual figures for 123 countries and found that, in 2007, the average country gave the Chinese government a net approval rating of +11% (measured as the percentage who approve minus the percentage of those who disapprove). A decade later, that number had dwindled to just +1%. Africans tend to think of China most highly, with a net rating of +34%, and Europeans are most wary, with a tally of -14%. But in every continent Gallup recorded a decline of at least five percentage points between 2007 and 2017.&lt;p&gt;The Confucius Institutes are unlikely to be the cause of this change in global opinion, since few people outside universities have encountered them. However, they do offer clues as to why China might have gained more foes than friends. Many academics have complained that the institutes spread propaganda and suppress discussion of sensitive topics, such as Taiwanese independence. A few Western universities have shut them down. A clumsy attempt to impress foreigners, it seems, might be worse than none at all. Perhaps some people have also been spooked by claims that China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/07/26/china-has-a-vastly-ambitious-plan-to-connect-the-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;global infrastructure-building project&lt;/a&gt;, is really a way to exert political influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Xi seems to have realised the need for an even softer touch. He is now intent on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/china/2019/02/07/the-communist-party-capitalises-on-foreign-interest-in-chinese-culture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;building Chinese Cultural Centres&lt;/a&gt;. These are not located on campuses and so avoid being seen as interfering with liberal institutions. And Chinese news agencies have turned their sights to Facebook, where they have acquired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/20/china-is-using-facebook-to-build-a-huge-audience-around-the-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hundreds of millions of followers&lt;/a&gt; who receive fluffy articles about the country. The Communist Party’s net approval rating got its first noticeable boost in 2018, rising from +1% to +4%, although the reason is not clear. It might take China a long time to recover the support that it has lost in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 02:41:10 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are the Victorians a model for Brexit Britain?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/24/are-the-victorians-a-model-for-brexit-britain]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_blp507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T17:17:56Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;WITH THERESA May on her way out of 10 Downing Street and Britain no closer to achieving the Brexit she promised, Anne McElvoy takes the long view.

But the relief is tinged with guilt. One minute toddlers can be watching Peppa Pig, and the next learning that the Moon landings were faked or that Earth is flat. YouTube and Netflix are designed to keep their audience hooked in ways that are creepy when used on adults; but when they involve children they are downright disturbing. Data are being collected from individuals too young to dress themselves, let alone consent to the myriad of uses to which the data are put.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not new. Rules have long governed children’s exposure to older forms of media—think of watersheds in television schedules, age-ratings in cinemas or restrictions on buying pornography. Yet for many years, both governments and tech firms have treated the web as a domain where those rules are so laxly enforced that they hardly apply at all. The industry hides behind the skimpiest of figleaves. Facebook’s terms of service forbid those under 13 from signing up, as do those of WhatsApp, a messaging service that Facebook owns. Both provisions are blithely ignored by millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platforms themselves are not well policed. According to one survey, 61% of parents who let their children watch YouTube report that their offspring have come across unsuitable content. Some videos purporting to be children’s cartoons have been found spiked with violence, or with predatory comments below the line. Now, though, propelled by worries about everything from religious radicalisation to exploitative content and grooming by paedophiles, governments are at last beginning to pay attention (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/25/how-to-make-social-media-safe-for-children&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;). In America Congress is drafting several bills. India may forbid data-collection from anyone who is under 18. Britain wants to force porn sites to implement robust age checks, or face being blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, this is welcome. Many liberals, like this newspaper, think that censorship laws are easily abused, and that too much mollycoddling is not just unnecessary but harmful. Yet it is hard to defend the idea that there should be one set of rules for old media and another—or none—for newer kinds. The argument that it is up to parents to control their children’s media consumption has much to recommend it. It would have even more if tech firms were not using every design trick they could think of—from push notifications to recommendation engines—to undermine that control, or if they were taking the initiative in rooting out harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk is that new rules cost a fortune to enforce and become obsolete as technology marches on. Hence governments should apply two principles. First, online rules should reflect the broad standards that are already in place for offline media. Obviously, these standards need to be adapted to suit a new generation of technology in which interaction is enabled, individual preferences can be catered for and viewing is on demand. But they apply to the same children and are a good foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second principle is that governments should not get bogged down trying to specify precisely how platforms should solve problems—setting out, for example, the details of what it means to identify when a child is using a site. That is a task for the tech firms, which can innovate and which understand their platforms better than anyone. Instead, regulators should demand results, and impose large sanctions for firms that fall short. The sorts of fines imposed by the GDPR, which are based on percentages of a firm’s global revenue, are a starting-point. Tech firms would be well advised to co-operate. Some are trying—YouTube’s “Kids” app is a start, but it should be aggressively promoted as the company’s default option for children. But even the most mercenary should see the way the wind is blowing. If they do not respond they will find their bad behaviour ends with tantrums and tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 01:40:35 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[British politics after Theresa May]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/24/british-politics-after-theresa-may]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_brp507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERESA MAY strode out of the door of 10 Downing Street in a crimson business suit and bowed to the inevitable. Having failed three times to get her Brexit deal through a hopelessly divided parliament, and confronted with a Tory insurrection over her proposed fourth attempt, she announced on May 24th that she would step down as leader of the Conservative Party and Britain’s prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret for me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit,” she declared. She then urged MPs to find the spirit of compromise. Had she left it there it might have been remembered as a dignified exit at the end of her dogged prime ministership. Instead she tried to set out her legacy—listing, among other things, measures to limit plastic waste—and only highlighted how little she managed to do. Then, as she gave thanks for the “honour of a lifetime”, a prime minister often derided as “Maybot” shed a tear and left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She will step down as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7th. The Party will then begin the formal process for selecting a successor. Nominations will close in the week beginning June 10th, followed by several rounds of voting among MPs, a process that will last until the end of the month. The MPs will then send two names to party members who will vote on who they like most, with the result of their vote &amp;quot;announced before parliament rises for summer. Mrs May will remain as prime minister until a new leader is found. This means that she will act as host to President Donald Trump when he arrives in Britain for his state visit on June 3rd, and will attend the 75th anniversary of D-Day on June 6th, something on which she is known to put great value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading Tories were quick to express their admiration for Mrs May—particularly for her determination and sense of duty. But there was something of a ritualistic quality to this: most Tories have been desperate to see the back of Mrs May for weeks. Thirty-six ministers resigned during her spell in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs May’s resignation came after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/23/another-british-prime-minister-is-destroyed-by-the-europe-question&quot;&gt;a surreal few days&lt;/a&gt; in British politics. On May 22nd she presented her revised EU withdrawal bill to the House of Commons, laboriously reading through the ten points that were supposed to overcome the House’s objections to the previous version. But it was clear that she had lost the confidence of both her government and party. The front bench around her was half-empty because the more pro-Brexit members of her cabinet were somewhere else discussing what to do next, and the benches behind her emptied as she spoke. This was not just a prime minister without authority but a prime minister without an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this took place against the background of a European election that Britain should never have taken part in. Polls suggest that the Tories are due to come a poor fourth—one even hinted that they could get no more than 7% of the vote—and that Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is likely to come first thanks to the votes of disillusioned Conservatives. It also took place against the background of a ticking clock. The European Union had offered Britain an extension of Article 50 (whose triggering began the Brexit process) to October 31st, so that it could find a route out of the impasse. But the government is now farther from finding that route than it was when the extension was granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate trigger for Mrs May’s departure was the failure of her revised withdrawal bill. But the bigger trigger was the general election that she called back in June 2017. Her instincts were right: increasing the Tories’ majority would have allowed her to increase her bargaining power with her party and ensure that she was not hostage to pro- or anti-Brexit factions. But the election was a debacle. The party produced a turgid manifesto that alienated voters with an ill-thought-out plan to make rich homeowners pay more for social care—a plan that was quickly dubbed the “dementia tax”. The party seriously underestimated Jeremy Corbyn’s appeal to the electorate and the quality of the Labour Party’s Momentum-powered political machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The election campaign also underlined Mrs May’s weaknesses as a practical politician. She refused to take part in a leaders’ debate and instead sent Amber Rudd, whose father had just died, to act as her champion. Whenever she deigned to campaign she was wooden and awkward. Mrs May is an introvert in a profession that demands a willingness to mingle with people and make them feel good about themselves. She is also a rigid micro-manager in a business that is by nature fluid and open-ended. Mrs May’s instinct is to surround herself with a tiny coterie of advisers (who are completely dependent on her) and to plan everything out in detail. But this has repeatedly proven fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British politics will now be consumed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/23/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm&quot;&gt;the race to succeed Mrs May&lt;/a&gt;. Some 20 MPs have put their hats in the ring and started parading their families (and kitchens) before an exasperated public. The front-runner is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/23/choosing-boris-johnson-as-prime-minister-would-be-a-dangerous-gamble&quot;&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the former foreign secretary. Mr Johnson is the clear favourite among party members and among pro-Brexit MPs (Jacob Rees-Mogg, the head of the hardline European Research Group, has been hosting dinners for him). And he has also been doing a good job of reaching out to his party’s pro-Remain liberal wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the rule-of-thumb in election races is that the favourite never wins the crown. Mr Johnson was also the clear favourite in the last leadership race, in 2016, but his bid imploded when his campaign manager, Michael Gove, decided that Mr Johson was not up to the job and decided to run himself. Mr Gove will hope to be a powerful contender this time. He has an impressive record of galvanising whatever departments he has run, from education to the environment, and recognises that the Conservative Party needs to do more than repeat its old mantras about unleashing market forces if it is to defeat Mr Corbyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messrs Johnson and Gove did more than any other Tories to win the Brexit vote for leavers. But they will have to contend with even purer Brexiteers, such as Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, who will be looking for any sign of treason. They will also have to contend with senior cabinet ministers such as Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary who ran the health service for six years, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary. With Mr Javid fading of late, the race could end up pitching Mr Hunt as the safe pair of hands against Mr Johnson as the charismatic risk taker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//embed.acast.com/theintelligencepodcast/thismayhurt-britishpolitics&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;215&quot;  frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conservative Party as a whole likes nothing more than a leadership race. But whoever wins this one will face one of the most difficult situations of any prime minister in modern times. The new leader will confront a party that is bitterly divided over Brexit, with ultras determined to leave at any cost and moderates determined to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The new chief will also confront a party that is completely split about where to go in terms of broader policy: should the Conservative Party redouble its commitment to Thatcherism—the position of many hard-line Brexiteers—or should it re-embrace the One Nation tradition that was obscured by the rise of Thatcherism? One-nation Tories—who include some Brexiteers as well as Remainers—think that the Conservative Party needs to engage in a broad policy rethink if it is to address the problems revealed by the financial crisis and the subsequent rise of Mr Corbyn. Many advocate radical devolution, a more activist economic policy and a bold programme of house-building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next leader will have to grapple with the same forces that have destroyed Mrs May: a country as well as a party that is torn over Brexit; a political system that is being pulled apart by the tension between representative and direct democracy; and a conflict with the European Union that, despite repeated statements to the contrary by Brexiteers, has most of the cards in its hand. Mrs May will not be the last prime minister to be brought to tears by Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/05/23/theresa-may-reaches-the-end-of-the-road&quot;&gt;Leader: Theresa May reaches the end of the road&lt;/a&gt; (May 23rd 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2019 23:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson” is a toothless satire]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/05/24/the-last-temptation-of-boris-johnson-is-a-toothless-satire]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_BKP514.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T14:31:32Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEW POLITICIANS like to be made fun of. Even fewer can stomach a character assassination. It takes a singular statesman to announce a leadership bid mere days after the premiere of a satirical play labelling him “one of the most divisive politicians of our time”. At the Park Theatre in London “The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson” dramatises the fateful dinner party in 2016 at which Mr Johnson (Will Barton), goaded by fellow Tory MP Michael Gove (Dugald Bruce-Lockhart) and Evgeny Lebedev (Tim Wallers), a media mogul, decided to campaign for Brexit. Its second act imagines the fall-out in 2029, when Johnson is weighing up his chances of gaining power on a platform of “Breentry”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Jonathan Maitland, a former BBC journalist, the play’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/30/brexit-dramas-channel-four-stage-plays-facts&quot;&gt;stated aim&lt;/a&gt; is to peel back Mr Johnson’s buffoonish exterior to expose a man “substantially motivated by personal ambition”. Throughout the play the character is haunted by the ghosts of prime ministers past: Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill (of whom Mr Johnson wrote a bestselling biography). Each of them brow-beats Boris with their own views on Brexit, and he seems to emerge from these encounters not as a scheming Machiavelli but as a man tormented by contradictory advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Barton uncannily replicates BoJo’s behavioural tics—the hair-ruffling, the bumbling gait, the posh speaking-voice and the ums and ahs—but he is given little else to work with. The play makes minimal effort to probe the man’s inner life, or question how affected these habits are (the hair-ruffling, it has been reported, is one of his ways of cultivating a disarming charm). Just before the interval, Johnson breaks from dinner to deliver a cod-Shakespearean soliloquy. At last he divulges a yearning for power but before his confession has had time to percolate, he distracts from it with humour. He mounts the kitchen counter, a bike helmet his crown, an orange his orb, a serving spoon his sceptre. The audience laughs, and any serious considerations of his character are forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the play’s first act is toothless satire, its second is rip-roaring farce. History repeats itself—another maddening interview with the BBC, another sex scandal, another leadership bid—now with clownish exaggeration. The plot dissolves into incoherence: in one scene Johnson, Blair, Thatcher and Churchill perform the hokey-cokey; in another, Johnson gets into a televised punch-up with Gove. “The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson” ends with things crashing down, quite literally, around the titular character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the play disappoints because Mr Johnson is not the “perfect subject”, as the playwright claims, but rather an impossible one. Trying to skewer him is the equivalent of trying to nail jelly to a wall. The politician knows that ridicule cannot hurt you if you’re willing to laugh at yourself: from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/01/boris-johnson-zip-wire&quot;&gt;dangling on zip wires&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-34530932/boris-johnson-rugby-tackles-schoolboy-in-japan-his-other-sporting-slips&quot;&gt;rugby tackling ten-year-olds&lt;/a&gt;, he is always in on the joke. Mr Johnson refuses to be ashamed of his personal or professional failures. Satires only serve to boost Mr Johnson’s comedic capital and, with it, his political magnetism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Maitland has said that “if there were a leadership election during the run, I’d be jumping for joy” and it seems he will get his wish. Towards the end of “The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson”, the Conservative chief whip (Arabella Weir) assures Johnson that people would vote for him for one simple reason: they know who he is. Last week &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; columnist Tim Stanley instructed the Tories to “send for Boris”, writing that “the fact that I don’t have to use his surname speaks volumes”; meanwhile, the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; insisted that “nobody else...is even recognisable to the voting public.” In that respect a retelling of his life and times—no matter how unsympathetic—will help, not hinder, him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson” continues at the Park Theatre, London, until June 8th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2019 22:40:34 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Life after Theresa May]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/24/life-after-theresa-may]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_brp507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERESA MAY strode out of the door of 10 Downing Street in a crimson business suit and bowed to the inevitable.

This was not just a prime minister without authority but a prime minister without an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this took place against the background of a European election that Britain should never have taken part in. Polls suggest that the Tories are due to come a poor fourth—one even hinted that they could get no more than 7% of the vote—and that Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is likely to come first thanks to the votes of disillusioned Conservatives. It also took place against the background of a ticking clock. The European Union had offered Britain an extension of Article 50 (whose triggering began the Brexit process) to October 31st, so that it could find a route out of the impasse. But the government is now farther from finding that route than it was when the extension was granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate trigger for Mrs May’s departure was the failure of her revised withdrawal bill. But the bigger trigger was the general election that she called back in June 2017. Her instincts were right: increasing the Tories’ majority would have allowed her to increase her bargaining power with her party and ensure that she was not hostage to pro- or anti-Brexit factions. But the election was a debacle. The party produced a turgid manifesto that alienated voters with an ill-thought-out plan to make rich homeowners pay more for social care—a plan that was quickly dubbed the “dementia tax”. The party seriously underestimated Jeremy Corbyn’s appeal to the electorate and the quality of the Labour Party’s Momentum-powered political machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The election campaign also underlined Mrs May’s weaknesses as a practical politician. She refused to take part in a leaders’ debate and instead sent Amber Rudd, whose father had just died, to act as her champion. Whenever she deigned to campaign she was wooden and awkward. Mrs May is an introvert in a profession that demands a willingness to mingle with people and make them feel good about themselves. She is also a rigid micro-manager in a business that is by nature fluid and open-ended. Mrs May’s instinct is to surround herself with a tiny coterie of advisers (who are completely dependent on her) and to plan everything out in detail. But this has repeatedly proven fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British politics will now be consumed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/23/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm&quot;&gt;the race to succeed Mrs May&lt;/a&gt;. Some 20 MPs have put their hats in the ring and started parading their families (and kitchens) before an exasperated public. The front-runner is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/23/choosing-boris-johnson-as-prime-minister-would-be-a-dangerous-gamble&quot;&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the former foreign secretary. Mr Johnson is the clear favourite among party members and among pro-Brexit MPs (Jacob Rees-Mogg, the head of the hardline European Research Group, has been hosting dinners for him). And he has also been doing a good job of reaching out to his party’s pro-Remain liberal wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the rule-of-thumb in election races is that the favourite never wins the crown. Mr Johnson was also the clear favourite in the last leadership race, in 2016, but his bid imploded when his campaign manager, Michael Gove, decided that Mr Johson was not up to the job and decided to run himself. Mr Gove will hope to be a powerful contender this time. He has an impressive record of galvanising whatever departments he has run, from education to the environment, and recognises that the Conservative Party needs to do more than repeat its old mantras about unleashing market forces if it is to defeat Mr Corbyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messrs Johnson and Gove did more than any other Tories to win the Brexit vote for leavers. But they will have to contend with even purer Brexiteers, such as Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, who will be looking for any sign of treason. They will also have to contend with senior cabinet ministers such as Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary who ran the health service for six years, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary. With Mr Javid fading of late, the race could end up pitching Mr Hunt as the safe pair of hands against Mr Johnson as the charismatic risk taker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//embed.acast.com/theintelligencepodcast/thismayhurt-britishpolitics&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;215&quot;  frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conservative Party as a whole likes nothing more than a leadership race. But whoever wins this one will face one of the most difficult situations of any prime minister in modern times. The new leader will confront a party that is bitterly divided over Brexit, with ultras determined to leave at any cost and moderates determined to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The new chief will also confront a party that is completely split about where to go in terms of broader policy: should the Conservative Party redouble its commitment to Thatcherism—the position of many hard-line Brexiteers—or should it re-embrace the One Nation tradition that was obscured by the rise of Thatcherism? One-nation Tories—who include some Brexiteers as well as Remainers—think that the Conservative Party needs to engage in a broad policy rethink if it is to address the problems revealed by the financial crisis and the subsequent rise of Mr Corbyn. Many advocate radical devolution, a more activist economic policy and a bold programme of house-building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next leader will have to grapple with the same forces that have destroyed Mrs May: a country as well as a party that is torn over Brexit; a political system that is being pulled apart by the tension between representative and direct democracy; and a conflict with the European Union that, despite repeated statements to the contrary by Brexiteers, has most of the cards in its hand. Mrs May will not be the last prime minister to be brought to tears by Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/05/23/theresa-may-reaches-the-end-of-the-road&quot;&gt;Theresa May reaches the end of the road&lt;/a&gt; (May 23rd 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2019 22:40:33 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Judith Kerr, an extraordinary life]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/05/24/judith-kerr-an-extraordinary-life]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_BKP513.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T11:45:10Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT WAS only ten days ago that Judith Kerr, at the age of 95, won Illustrator of the Year at the British Book Awards, the publishing trade’s annual celebration of the best in the business. Since Ms Kerr had been a heroine of British children’s literature from the publication of her first book, “The Tiger Who Came to Tea”, in 1968, one might reasonably say it was about time, too. But it was only the year before, in 2018, that the awards deigned to recognise illustrators at all. The first winner was Axel Scheffler, the illustrator of Julia Donaldson’s “Gruffalo” books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Ms Kerr never lacked for attention from her millions of adoring readers (and their parents). “The Tiger Who Came to Tea”—in which the eponymous feline arrives at the home of a girl named Sophie and proceeds to eat all the food in the house and drink all the water from the taps—had sold 1m copies by its author’s 94th year and has been the subject of a touring exhibition and a travelling stage show. Equally beloved was Ms Kerr’s stories about Mog, a family cat; the series finished with the ground-breaking “Goodbye Mog”, in which the beloved pet died. Ms Kerr was nearly 80 when the book was published in 2002 and said that she wanted to address the subject of death. At her age, she said, “you begin to think about those who are going to be left—the children, the grandchildren. I just wanted to say: Remember. Remember me. But do get on with your lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Kerr’s own life was an extraordinary one. Born in Berlin in 1923, her father was Alfred Kerr, a prominent theatre writer and a vocal critic of the Nazi regime. “He had a very strong sense of Jewish ethics,” Ms Kerr said in 2016. “He was brought up in the Jewish faith but he decided at about 20 that he didn’t believe in God. People used to ask us why we didn’t go to RE classes at school and, aged five, I used to say, ‘I am a freethinker!’ which is what I had been told I was.” Warned in 1933 that the Nazi regime was about to confiscate the family’s passports, they fled to Switzerland, then France, finally ending up in Great Britain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She trained at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, and while working as an art teacher met her husband, Nigel Kneale, a screenwriter. The couple had two children, Matthew and Tacy: there were a lot of visits to the zoo when the pair were young. Ms Kerr explained the genesis of her first book plainly: “I made it up to amuse my children because we were bored and because their father was away filming for very long days at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971 she published “When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit”, in which the Kerr family’s escape from Nazi Germany was transformed into a story of adventure rather than terror—Ms Kerr would say in later life that her parents concealed their own fear to ensure that was how she and her brother Michael perceived it at the time. It became the first volume in her “Out of Hitler Time” trilogy; in 2012 she received an OBE for services to children’s literature and Holocaust education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children wrote to her from all over the world, a fact she found “hugely cheering”: “You feel that somebody is quite fond of you, even if you don’t know them!” She felt that her life had been an extraordinarily fortunate one. “I remember being asked when I first started trying to do books: ‘What do you want to do?’ And I said: ‘I just want to be able to do well enough that I can go on doing it.’” That is precisely what she did. Her last book, “The Curse of the School Rabbit”, will be published in June.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2019 20:40:16 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[This May hurt: British politics]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/24/this-may-hurt-british-politics]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_blm508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T11:40:08Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRITAIN&amp;#x27;S PRIME minister has at last revealed the date she will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/05/23/theresa-may-reaches-the-end-of-the-road&quot;&gt;step down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
