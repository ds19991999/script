Let’s hope it has an equally profound impact on the history industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades academics have focused on history from below—hence all those university seminars on bastardy in 15th-century Nottingham and hand-loom weavers in 18th-century Lincoln. They have done this for obvious intellectual reasons: Karl Marx’s contention that “the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle” is undoubtedly a powerful insight. Added to this is a sociological reason: the vast expansion of the universities (and the arrival of a more socially and ethnically diverse student population) means that historians are reluctant to teach the same thing as they did when they were training a future ruling class. A changing student body requires a changing curriculum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Game of Thrones” suggests they were doubly wrong. They are wrong about demand: even in a democratic age people are fixated on the old-fashioned history of kings and queens: that is the history of people who combine something that is quite unusual (lots of power) with other things that are quite usual (personal quirks and family quarrels). History may be in decline as an option in universities precisely because it focuses so much on history from below rather than on history from above. In some ways “Game of Thrones” is a dramatic presentation of Walter Bagehot’s great insight about the British monarchy, that it thrived in a democratic age precisely because it humanised power by putting a family and its foibles on the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also wrong about something more fundamental. “Game of Thrones” is compelling precisely because it recognises that dynastic struggles have often taken precedence over class struggles. Up until the first world war, the world was run by a collection of dynasties that possessed every human foible imaginable (from insanity to dwarfism to incestuous longings) and who spent their lives playing the game of thrones: forming dynastic alliances, sometimes even marrying their relatives, going to war over rival family claims to the throne and, above all, scheming to maximise their power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Game of Thrones” gets a remarkable number of big things right about the nature of dynastic societies. One is that the dynastic principle eliminates the difference between the public and private realms, a difference that is fundamental to democratic and meritocratic societies. Public life in a dynasty is shaped by the personal foibles of the monarch. Power is wielded by people who can get physically close to the king. The world’s oldest political offices are all related to the monarch’s physical needs—looking after his horse or falcons, or guarding his bedchamber—and were usually reserved for members of his own family or the most blue-blooded aristocrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second is that dynasties put biology at the heart of society. The fate of kingdoms depends on the physical fitness of kings and their ability to produce male heirs (Britain arguably had its first Brexit, the Reformation, because of Henry VIII’s difficulties in producing a male heir). Political dynasties can become global powers if they can marry the right people and produce enough children (the Saxe-Coburgs were the greatest dynasty builders of the 18th and 19th centuries, succeeding first in capturing the British throne and then, because of Queen Victoria’s clever marriage scheming, putting their progeny on the thrones of most of Europe). Royal daughters had to expect to be pawns in the game of alliance building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which leads me to unveil my idea for an HBO production of my own: a history of the Habsburg dynasty. This would be relatively cheap by the standards of recent productions: most of the great Habsburg palaces are still intact and Vienna’s museums are stuffed full of suits of armour, portraits, furniture, table settings etc. And the story is every bit as weird as the story of the “Game of Thrones”. The Habsburgs were so prone to in-breeding that people joked that they married their cousins and slept with their siblings. Charles II of Spain was a mass of genetic problems: his head was too big for his body and his tongue was too big for his mouth, so that he had difficulty speaking, and constantly drooled; his first wife complained that he suffered from premature ejaculation and his second wife that he was impotent; as if that wasn’t enough, he also suffered from convulsions. He died at 39, mercifully without an heir. These personal peccadilloes didn’t prevent the Hapsburgs from becoming champion players of the game of thrones, producing one of the most far-flung and enduring empires the world has seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CONSERVATIVE” is one of those words that comes with an implied question: what is it that you want to conserve? Britain’s Conservative Party is in such turmoil at the moment because it is at sixes and sevens over its answer to this question. In the Cameron-Osborne years it wanted to conserve the Clinton-Blair consensus: that is a combination of free-market economics (symbolised by support for globalisation), social liberalism (symbolised by support for gay marriage) and government activism, particularly in the creation of human capital. That was always an elite project that failed to stir the emotions of most conservative voters and, when it came to gay marriage and hyper-globalisation, may well have repelled them. But it was an elite project that was destroyed in the flames of the Iraq war, arguably the first and last war of neo-conservative globalisation, and the 2008 financial crisis. Now the battle is on between three different answers to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most powerful is the nation-state. The heart of Brexit is not racism (as some Remainers annoyingly claim) or a desire to be truly global as opposed to narrowly European-focused (as Boris Johnson pretends). It is the desire to restore the sovereignty of the nation-state. Brexiteers don’t just dislike the demands that the European Union poses in terms of agreeing to its rules and regulations. They dislike the idea, beloved of some if not all in Brussels, that the nation-state is an anachronism that we need to get beyond. The fury of the Brexiteers’ resistance to Theresa May’s half-way house approach to Brexit, combined with the flight of many Conservative voters to the Brexit Party, suggests that, to survive, the Conservative Party may have no choice but to become the party of the nation-state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This defence of the nation-state is linked to a broader defence of the traditional British way of life: that is, Britain’s green and pleasant land (Michael Gove’s agenda at the department of the environment); its provincial cities (the devolution initiative and the creation of new mayors); its built environment (the department of housing’s “building beautiful” initiative which has been sadly overshadowed by the row about Sir Roger Scruton).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second answer is the traditional values of family and faith. This is the answer that the Cameroons most disliked. Proclaiming a faith in God or a belief in the traditional family was a sure way of getting yourself kicked off the Notting Hill dinner-party invitation list. But they were not alone: Theresa May, the daughter of a vicar and a regular churchgoer, initially embraced transgender rights on the grounds that it was the new gay marriage. The Conservative grassroots are rather more tradition-minded than this, particularly when it comes to transgender activists. Jacob Rees-Mogg has demonstrated that you can win a large grassroots following by speaking out unashamedly for “faith and family”, particularly if you link defence of faith and family to defence of the nation-state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third answer is the capitalist system. The Conservative Party has traditionally been the party of business and the City—indeed there was a time, between the wars, when the party was actually dominated by businessmen such as Stanley Baldwin, whose family owned an ironworks, and Neville Chamberlain, whose family once produced a third of the world’s nails. I suspect that Hammond, the chancellor of the exchequer, believes that his party’s main job is to create a favourable environment for business, though he doesn’t exactly wear his political philosophy on his sleeve. The same may be true of Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closely connected answer is “freedom”. Many Tories regard the defence of capitalism as part of a broader defence of freedom. (They also argue, from a public-relations point of view, that “freedom” is a much easier sell than “capitalism”.) Liz Truss, Mr Hammond’s underling as chief secretary of the Treasury and a woman who exudes leadership ambition from every paw, is a leading proponent of this school. Her shtick is to update Mrs Thatcher’s freedom agenda for a populist age: continue with the Thatcherite policies of deregulating markets and encouraging competition but also put a heavy emphasis on the gig economy and social liberalism. Her aim is to reinforce the Thatcherite revolution by showing young people that their personal interests, both as consumers and as young professionals, lies in embracing the start-up economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Conservatives would no doubt argue that the proper answer to the question is “all of the above”: you need a fusion of all these things for each one of them to make sense—for example, you can’t defend Britain’s built environment without having the wherewithal provided by a successful economy. They would also argue that defending Britain’s nation-state—particularly the nation-state’s ability to generate wealth—sometimes entails sacrificing sovereignty to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “fusionist” position is the default position of the party’s pragmatic establishment. But the logic of current politics—not just because of the Brexit debate but also because of the surge of populism—is to force people to make choices that they’ve previously been able to avoid. Conservatives increasingly feel that they have to make a choice between the nation-state and business—and indeed between traditional values and business. Businesses have made it abundantly clear that they have little time for small-minded nationalism. The global market is their God. They have also made it pretty clear that they don’t have that much time for other important conservative virtues such as defending the family or community: Hollywood pumps out material that undermines the traditional families. Big companies such as HSBC (which has plastered London with annoying ads) is determined to prove how woke it is. Big data companies yoke the values of the millennium left with the business practices of the robber barons. I’m sure that Boris Johnson expressed the views of a growing number of Conservatives when he splutterd “fuck business”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROGNOSTICATORS are always thinking that they have discovered “the future” in some bit of the world or other. Hegel thought that he had discovered it in Prussia and John Reed in Soviet Russia (“I have seen the future and it works”). In the 1960s there was almost a consensus that the future lay in California. At the risk of sounding as idiotic as John Reed I would like to nominate Israel. I recently spent a week in that extraordinary country in order to get a break from writing about Brexit. I was repeatedly struck by the extent to which Israel prefigures trends that are spreading around much of the world: the rise of religion and nationalism; the coexistence of a high-tech sector with orthodox communities; the division of society into rival communities that are so hostile to each other that they need to be kept apart by a wall; and the rise of strongmen leaders who argue, in effect, that the imperatives of national security override namby-pamby worries about civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the second world war the survivors of the Holocaust drew a sharply different conclusion from Nazism than the victorious Allies. The Allies concluded that nationalism needed to be constrained or even, in the case of the architects of the European Union, transcended. By contrast Zionists concluded that the Jewish people needed a nation-state of their own where they could be made safe from any potential enemies—and where they could allow their culture to flourish as never before. Today dreams of a post-nationalist future are dying and the idea that peoples need a place that they can call home for reasons of both self-fulfilment and self-protection is once more on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DURING my Israel adventure I stopped off at a motor stop between Jerusalem and Nazareth. I was struck by the way that Arabs in traditional dress mixed easily with Israeli soldiers (though who knows what was going on in their heads). I was also impressed by the way that a familiar modern economy and a traditional barter economy seemed to co-exist—having handed over my money for a cappuccino in exactly the same way as I would in London, I was approached by Bedouin hawkers trying to sell cordless drills and rides on a camel. How exotic! I thought until I recalled my own experiences back in England. I frequently visit Liddle to buy necessities (bread, grapes, chocolate) only to emerge with a cordless drill or a “smart bicycle helmet” that signals which way you’re turning. The prices are so low that it seems foolish to pass by the jumble of weird goods placed in the centre of the store. All Liddle needs now is a camel or two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACK from the Holy Land I went to the dentist with a toothache. The dentist poked around for a bit, ummed and erred, and referred me to a root-canal specialist. I showed up to the specialist full of dread about the pain, not to mention the cost, of another root canal. A bit more poking and prodding and the specialist pronounced that she couldn’t find anything wrong with my root canals. So why the persistent toothache? She asked me if I had been under any unusual pressure that might have resulted in me clenching my teeth together more than usual. When I replied that I was a political journalist writing about Brexit she immediately pronounced that “that would explain it…it’s bad enough for the rest of us without having to write about it”. Brexit is a toothache as well as a headache. I’m sending my dental bill to Boris Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 00:06:39 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to hack the freeconomy]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/news/2019/04/19/how-to-hack-the-freeconomy]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_EFD003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-19T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 19th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.1843magazine.com/&quot;&gt;1843&lt;/a&gt;, our sister magazine of ideas, lifestyle and culture.

It was aptly named. One of my companions that night was a friend from the tech industry – he had studied at Stanford Graduate School of Business and been an executive at a self-driving-car firm before founding his own startup. But as we ate, he flaunted a different sort of achievement: he had lived in the Bay Area for years and never paid for a mattress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend, who asked not to be named, approached this challenge methodically. First he compiled a spreadsheet of all the mattress firms’ free trials and return policies. Then he proceeded to take advantage of them one by one, “buying” six mattresses in turn and returning them just before the deadline, at no extra cost – and getting all his money back. He usually made the switch just before he moved apartments, so he didn’t have to lug a heavy mattress across town. As he described his strategy, I found myself torn between admiration and disgust. His ruse was ingenious, but was creating an Excel file about bedding really the best use of his time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of promotions is a worldwide phenomenon, but techies stalk deals with extraordinary ingenuity. The perks of the “freeconomy” range from the quotidian to the luxurious. Startups, flush with funding from venture capitalists and eager to grab the attention of new customers, offer free food delivery, prepared meal kits, grocery-shopping, dog-walking, errand-running, moving, laundry and ride-hailing. Some techies boast that they have even figured out how to get free nights on Airbnb and nearly free flights from JetSmarter, which offers on-demand private jets. San Francisco is now more expensive to live in than any other city in America, but the biggest irony of its freeconomy is that the people who are the most adept at exploiting it are the people who need its benefits least: well-to-do nerds with high-paying jobs that come with plenty of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think I was, if not a freeconomy professional, at least a high-level amateur. Since I moved back to San Francisco, my home town, four years ago, I have learnt the local tradecraft. Locals often use multiple email accounts and different credit cards when signing up for apps so that they appear to be a first-time customer. I play hard to get, wandering away from a service for months only to sprint back as soon as they offer me a coupon. When I need a ride, I play Uber against Lyft to see which ride-hailing service offers the better deal. I’m currently using Lyft: they offered me 25% off ten rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have come to realise, however, that I am nothing but a novice. One popular route to free riches involves a “referral code”, which gives each person who uses it a credit for helping secure new customers. Felix, who runs a startup in San Francisco, has taken this to extremes. He accomplished what he calls his “Bay Area hack” by buying around $600 in advertisements on Google and placing his referral code from Uber in each ad. He spent hours fine-tuning his approach until his ads often had a higher click-through rate than Uber’s own. For each person who signed up to Uber’s service through his ad, he received a credit. He eventually amassed $30,000 in credits, which allowed him to ride around the city in Uber’s cars and eat three meals a day from UberEats, the company’s food-delivery service, for a whole year without paying a cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies know consumers try to take advantage of them, but some entrepreneurs choose to be wilfully blind to it. “A little bit of you doesn’t want to find out,” says Sean Behr, the boss of Stratim. “You want to believe your product has traction.” His startup, which offers parking services to companies, had to pivot its business away from cheap on-demand valet parking when consumers like me exploited it feverishly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The freeconomy may ultimately fizzle out when the tech boom sputters and venture capitalists grow less comfortable with their cash being used to win new customers at any cost. In the meantime, this bargain-hunting tells us three things about the mindsets of techies in Silicon Valley. First, to compete with giants like Google in a cut-throat talent market, companies are offering their employees a huge variety of perks, from meditation rooms to concierge services to egg-freezing for women. This corporate munificence has led to entitlement. Techies expect all companies, not just their employers, to take care of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, techies are more concerned about getting a good deal than they are about ownership – which explains why people are willing to return mattresses and why many techies get their sheets from a company that offers free samples. For them, living in the Bay Area feels like being at the centre of a well-funded research lab where local startups test new ideas and services to see how well they fare. “I love San Francisco. You see the future that will never work,” one high-profile entrepreneur mused at a dinner party, as a delivery person cycled up a steep hill in a far-flung part of the city to deliver food from miles away at almost no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, and most importantly, exploiting the freeconomy is a way to take back control. Tech companies have amassed fortunes by tracking consumers, gathering as much data as they can about them, predicting what they are looking for and manipulating them to spend as much time with their products as possible. This is especially true for firms like Facebook that are now under fire for making money out of surveilling consumers across the internet. But plenty of other companies make it their business to know consumers: they employ people to study users’ locations and behaviour in order to lure them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my mattress-scheming friend, getting free things from companies “in some small way allows you to reclaim sovereignty on your own internal state. It’s David versus Goliath. It’s sticking up for the individual over the company.” And who doesn’t like rooting for the little guy, even if his slingshot was heavily discounted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author, Alexandra Suich Bass, is West Coast correspondent for &lt;/em&gt;The Economist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:06:32 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[At Easter, beware chocolate-scoffing dogs]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/19/at-easter-beware-chocolate-scoffing-dogs]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_WOC760.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-19T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 19th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EASTER-EGG hunts are a delight for children, a pain for parents to organise—and potentially lethal for the family pooch. The worst a chocolate binge can do for a mischievous four-year-old is a dizzying sugar high. For dogs, however, the theobromine found in cocoa beans can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and seizures. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/vetrec/181/25/684.full.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of British vet clinics between 2012 and 2017 found a large spike in canine chocolate intoxication in the weeks around Easter. Some 60% of vets reported such a case in 2018. (A similar problem occurs at Christmas.)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, all of the poorly pets in the sample recovered from their snack-induced ailments. But owners should beware: a pup with a sweet tooth will stop at nothing to get its fill. The study’s authors report examples of dogs slurping chocolate liqueurs and cups of cocoa. Chocolate oranges and Toblerones are especially popular, with one naughty boy guzzling six of both. The worst offender managed to consume an entire “garden of Easter eggs hidden for a large party of small children”.

Robert Mueller’s report has been downloaded almost 100,000 times from government websites. Many more people will have looked at copies emailed by friends or hosted on media websites. The interest in a government report more than 400 pages long is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Mueller spent nearly two years investigating links between the Russian government and President Donald Trump’s campaign. Last month the attorney-general, William Barr, released a four-page summary, stating that the report did not establish that anyone involved with Mr Trump’s campaign “conspired or co-ordinated with Russia” in its election-interference efforts, nor did it establish that Mr Trump committed obstruction of justice. Mr Trump treated that summary as dispositive. No collusion, no obstruction, “Complete and Total EXONERATION,” as he tweeted. The full report paints a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first 170 pages concern Russia. They begin by laying out the scope of Russia’s influence operation. Some of this may be familiar to those who perused two previous indictments issued by Mr Mueller’s team. One was against members of the GRU, Russia’s military-intelligence agency, who hacked into and stole emails from servers belonging to the Democratic Party and to people working for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The other was against the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian troll farm run by a Russian businessman closely linked to Vladimir Putin, which engaged in a social-media campaign to sow discord and damage Mrs Clinton’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Americans have understandably been focused on the evidence about whether the president was complicit in a foreign power’s attempt to sway the election, this part of the report is arguably the most important part from the point of view of protecting future elections. Unfortunately, America’s deep political divisions are all too easy to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRA staff sitting in St Petersburg (the one on the Neva rather than on Tampa Bay) pretended to be Americans on social media and staked out divisive positions on either end of the political spectrum, passing themselves off as supporters of Mr Trump, or of Black Lives Matter. The outfit also organised multiple real-world events, starting with a “confederate rally” in Houston in late 2015, as well as several pro-Trump rallies in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania (a state that Mr Trump won narrowly and unexpectedly). Some rallies, the report explains, drew few attendees; others drew hundreds. Candidate Trump pointed to one event organised by the IRA in Florida as evidence of his popularity there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian government and the Trump campaign were working to the same purpose, and each hoped the other would help it out. But as Mr Barr noted in both his written summary and his press conference, Mr Mueller’s team did not establish that anyone from Mr Trump’s campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia in those efforts. Here is the how Mr Mueller’s team put it:&lt;br/&gt;“Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This judgment turns on the absence of any agreement, explicit or implicit, between the parties to conspire, which seems fair. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm of Trump campaign members for working with people with ties to a government that kills journalists, imprisons political rivals and had recently pulled off the first land grab in Europe since the second world war, is quite something to see when it is all put in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Manafort, Mr Trump’s campaign chair, who was deep in debt to a Russian oligarch, shared internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, one of his Kiev-based employees with apparent links to both that oligarch and Russian intelligence. Even Rick Gates, Mr Manafort’s right-hand man, believed Mr Kilimnik was a “spy”. That did not stop Mr Manafort from meeting Mr Kilimnik. George Papadopoulos, a junior foreign-policy advisor who pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators, tried to let the campaign know early on that the Russians had compromising material on Mrs Clinton (nobody thought to tell the FBI). Donald Trump junior arranged a meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised “dirt” on Mrs Clinton. And of course Mr Trump himself was pursuing a Trump Tower Moscow project until just five months before the election, while simultaneously pushing for better relations with Moscow. None of this may have been illegal, but had voters known about it they may have made a different choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report’s second part deals with obstruction of justice. Both in his summary and again in his press conference, Mr Barr noted that Mr Mueller declined to make a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” regarding whether to bring charges. Guiding that reluctance was long-standing policy against indicting a sitting president, which, wrote Mr Mueller, led him “not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the president committed crimes.” Because no charges could be brought, Mr Trump would have no chance to clear his name at trial. But, Mr Mueller continues, “if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state…Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, neither does it exonerate him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustaining an obstruction charge requires three things: an obstructive act, a connection between that act and an actual or contemplated criminal proceeding, and corrupt intent. Mr Mueller comes closest to accusing Mr Trump of meeting those three conditions in the firing of James Comey, a former FBI director, six days after Mr Comey declined to publicly state that Mr Trump was not personally under investigation. Afterwards he told the Russian foreign minister, “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” That could be an obstructive act because, although it did not stop the investigation into his campaign’s links with Russia, it could affect how Mr Comey’s successor conducted that investigation. But Mr Mueller leaves open whether Mr Trump’s motive was a desire to impede the investigation, or simple anger that a subordinate failed to do as told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor is that the only occasion on which the president tried to influence the investigation. He tried to get the White House Counsel to remove Mr Mueller, and then to deny that he had made that request. He tried to get Jeff Sessions, the former attorney-general, to curtail the terms of Mr Mueller’s investigation, and to rescind his recusal from overseeing it. He tried to prevent the disclosure of embarrassing emails. He seemed to dangle a pardon before Mr Manafort. After Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, began cooperating with Mr Mueller, Mr Trump called him a “rat”, and publicly insulted his family. As Mr Mueller notes, “the president&amp;#x27;s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The striking thing about this section, when read in full, is how self-wounding Mr Trump’s behaviour has been. Had he simply kept quiet, and let Mr Mueller complete his investigation into his campaign’s links into Russia, the obstruction investigation never would have happened. Instead, he interfered clumsily on many occasions, allowing the special counsel to amass a damning record of the president’s truculence, dishonesty and contempt for federal investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Barr said in his press conference that Mr Trump “was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency.” But all presidents are harassed and attacked by the opposition party; none in recent memory have responded as Mr Trump has. Mr Barr also said that the White House has “fully co-operated” with Mr Mueller’s investigation. But Mr Trump never agreed to be interviewed by Mr Mueller’s team. Instead, he provided written answers to questions, which, said Mr Mueller, were “insufficien[t]…the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he “does not ‘recall’ or ‘remember’ or have an ‘independent recollection’” of information called for by the questions. Other answers were ‘incomplete or imprecise’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Barr also stated that Mr Mueller “did not indicate that his purpose was to leave the decision [whether Mr Trump obstructed justice] to Congress…it was my prerogative as attorney general to make that decision.” Mr Mueller’s report is not so clear: “Congress has authority,” he wrote, “to prohibit a president’s corrupt use of his authority…The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that Congress will do so: the Democratic leadership in the House has sensibly concluded that impeachment proceedings could backfire politically. There is nothing in the new report that will suddenly persuade Republicans in the Senate to abandon the president. It is nonetheless an extraordinary document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read the whole thing for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 17:07:28 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alan García, Peru’s ex-president, killed himself as police sought to arrest him]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/17/alan-garcia-perus-ex-president-killed-himself-as-police-sought-to-arrest-him]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_AMP502_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-17T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 17th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ON THE evening of April 16th, Alan García, Peru’s former president, went on the radio to declare he was innocent of accusations of corruption that were swirling around. Rumours of his likely arrest were pure supposition, he insisted: “I can tell you that I was not born to steal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when police officers went to his home in Lima the next morning to detain him, Mr García asked to make a phone call, went into a room and closed the door, according to the interior minister, Carlos Morán. Minutes later, a shot rang out, and police found Mr García sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head. He died a few hours later in a hospital. Mr García perished as he had lived as a politician—surrounded by controversy.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;He was one of several senior figures caught up in a corruption case that is convulsing Peruvian political life; two other presidents are either in detention or have served time in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The scandal stems from the Lava Jato (“Car Wash”) investigation in Brazil, which has spread to other countries. Brazilian prosecutors have won convictions for 155 people, and prison sentences totalling more than 2,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One major part of the investigation concerns Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company, which has been found to have paid billions of dollars in bribes to politicians across Latin America in exchange for lucrative contracts. In Peru more than a dozen politicians, including Mr García, have been implicated since 2016. Last November, prosecutors barred him from leaving the country for 18 months while he was investigated in several Odebrecht-linked cases, particularly allegations of taking bribes in 2008 in connection with the construction of the metro in Lima. He sought asylum in the Uruguayan embassy in Lima, which was denied. In April, details of corruption involving his confidants started to leak; senior Odebrecht officials were set to testify next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García’s first term in office, from 1985 to 1990, was marked by disastrous populist policies. In 1989, inflation rocketed above 7,000% and economic output shrank by 12%. But his second term, from 2006 to 2011, went much better. A free-trade agreement with the United States set the stage for subsequent deals with China, the European Union and a number of other countries. Average economic growth was impressive, at about 7% per year, and inflation and unemployment remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Although he oversaw strong economic growth, Mr García’s terms were marked by allegations of graft. Two years after the first ended in 1990 he went into exile in Colombia, living between there and France for eight years to avoid prosecution. He returned to make a remarkable political comeback after the statute of limitations had run out in 2001, and won an election in 2006. After his second term ended in 2011, he was again investigated, only to be let off the hook on technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Lava Jato investigation was too extensive to escape, however. It has exposed the corruption and incompetence at the heart of Peruvian politics. Prosecutors have asked the United States to extradite Alejandro Toledo, Mr García’s predecessor, who stands accused of accepting a $20m bribe from Odebrecht (he denies the allegation). Both of Mr García’s successors are also implicated: Ollanta Humala spent nearly nine months in prison. He was released a year ago this month, pending trial for allegedly receiving $3m in undeclared campaign funds from the construction giant. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was detained on April 10th on similar charges, but was then taken to hospital suffering from high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Odebrecht net has also ensnared Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the conservative Popular Force party and daughter of a former president, Alberto Fujimori. Both are sitting in prison. She is there for allegedly accepting a $1m campaign contribution from Odebrecht. Her father was convicted of violating human rights during his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Mr García may have ended his torment. But the consequences of the Odebrecht scandal will be felt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 02:06:20 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Attempts to improve public health in Bangladesh appear to have misfired]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/18/attempts-to-improve-public-health-in-bangladesh-appear-to-have-misfired]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_WOC277.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GIVEN A CHOICE between using a nearby water well known to be contaminated with arsenic or a more distant one not known to be poisoned, every sane person would opt for the latter. In Bangladesh in the early 2000s, however, that appears to have been the wrong decision. In 1994 the government began a massive campaign to convince households drawing water from shallow backyard wells with high concentrations of arsenic to switch to deeper wells or streams that were free of the toxic metal. Arsenic is present naturally in groundwater across the globe, but is especially prevalent in Bangladesh. In 1999, roughly 65% of Bangladeshis were drinking water with unsafe levels of arsenic, which could lead to increased rates of cancer and infant mortality as well as decreased intelligence quotient for affected children. However, alternative sources were typically farther away from people’s homes, increasing the likelihood that users would make fewer trips and store their water for longer periods of time. And improperly stored water is often mishandled, increasing the rates of cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases. As a result, by asking people not to use wells polluted with arsenic, the government unintentionally caused the number of deaths resulting from ingesting water contaminated by faecal matter to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Nina Buchmann, an economist at Stanford, and her co-authors collected data from 3,138 Bangladeshi households between 2007 and 2009. Their data included a sample of more than 12,000 children born between 1980 and 2007, which allowed them to evaluate the mortality rate among households that did and did not switch water sources during the government’s campaign. According to their study, by 2004 Bangladeshis who switched to getting their water from far-away wells had a mortality rate four times as high as that of families who still drew from a shallow backyard well. They found that the increase in deaths was higher in households that were farther away from a deep well, which increases the storage time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Bangladesh has one of the gravest arsenic-poisoning problems in the world, foreign public-health experts have generally praised the government’s efforts to curb the use of backyard wells. In just eight years, the group of governmental and non-governmental organisations spread awareness of contamination to the majority of the country’s households. But the evidence that the push has actually had a negative net effect on people’s health highlights the risk that even well-thought-out public policy often has unintended consequences. The biggest barrier to clean water in Bangladesh now might be education about proper handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 01:08:12 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jet Airways stops all operations]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2019/04/18/jet-airways-stops-all-operations]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_blp907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T11:06:20Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;IT HAS BEEN a slow, painful, descent. For months, Jet Airways, once India’s second largest airline, has been failing. Planes were grounded for non-payment of leases, fuel deliveries stopped, flights inevitably cancelled, frustrated customers denied access to lounges and subject to unending frustrations. Unpaid pilots loudly threatened to strike and quietly disembarked to work for competitors. Non-stop meetings were held by investors and lenders to concoct a rescue plan, but little progress towards one was made. When an announcement finally came on April 18th that all flights had been suspended, it was hardly a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The final blow was the unwillingness of a consortium of banks to release emergency funding. They had been burned during collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012 in similar circumstances. And they had no faith that the outcome would be any different this time around. There had been some moments of optimism, most strikingly in March when the airline’s founder and controlling shareholder Naresh Goyal voluntarily agreed to surrender control. That had sparked hope that Etihad Airways, which held a 24% stake, would step forward. And it was widely believed that in the final states of a national election campaign, the administration of Narendra Modi would not allow Jet to collapse. Quiet steps would be taken to push state-controlled banks to do whatever was required to keep it afloat.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But a lack of confidence in the airline’s management proved overwhelming. The government did not intervene to save the airline. And Etihad, burned by the bankruptcy of Air Berlin and Alitalia in 2017, two other airlines in which it had stakes, was loathe to throw more good money after bad. The announcement that all operations were grounded came through a notice filed to the Bombay Stock Exchange saying that a consortium of lenders led by the country’s largest financial institution, the State Bank of India, had denied the company’s request for more money. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What happens next, particularly to the 16,500 or so workers it directly employs is unclear. A sale process is under way, with hopes that it will be completed by the end of May. But whether there is anything left to be sold depends on what, by then, are the company’s assets. Its planes were largely acquired through leases that have been voided because of non-payment. Many of its best employees will have left for other companies. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;That leaves what has been its most valuable asset since it was founded in 1993: the landing and take-off slots it has accumulated at airports in Mumbai and Delhi. But these apparently come with conditions of usage that are likely to have been violated by the suspension of flights. Whether the landing rights are retained by the administrators or are reallocated for free to other carriers–as competitors hope–will play a large role in what now unfolds along with a second issue that has so far received little attention. Air India, the country’s state-owned flag carrier, is in deep financial trouble as well. A restructuring has been tried and delayed because of the political sensitivities involved and the clout of its trade unions. But as with Jet, its problems cannot be ignored indefinitely. Many believe the time for such a large undertaking to occur will be after the next election–which will be concluded as early as next month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 23:06:50 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mauricio Macri freezes prices]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/04/18/mauricio-macri-freezes-prices]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_blp905.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAURICIO MACRI&amp;#x27;S original plan was to address Argentina’s citizens on television on the final working day before the Easter break. But he opted for a folksier way of presenting an economic package that he hopes will rescue his chances of being re-elected president in October. He appeared in a taped video, knocking on the door of a house belonging to a young working-class couple, then sitting down with them to explain his plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We’ve done everything to try to fix the long-term in our country, and we’re going to win the battle,” said Mr Macri from the couple’s living-room. “We’re now giving you a respite, some relief for the months ahead.” He left it to his ministers to fill in the details at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are a change of course for a president who sought to undo the effects of more than a decade of populist government. The most important one is a revival of a price-control mechanism in force under the two Peronist presidents who preceded him, Néstor Kirchner and his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. In Mr Macri’s version, which he, like the Kirchners, calls “precios cuidados” (“curated prices”), the price of 64 consumer items, from milk to jam, will be frozen for six months (ie, until the eve of the election). An “army” of inspectors, under the direction of the production ministry, will enforce supermarkets’ adherence to the freeze. The government also said it would not go ahead with planned price rises this year in electricity, gas and public transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another move to contain inflation, the central bank said it would not allow the peso to weaken as much as it had planned. Starting this week it will spend up to $60m a day to support the currency. The money comes from the IMF, which has agreed to lend Argentina $57bn to support economic reforms. The government has also opened new credit lines for pensioners and families with children and expanded a plan to build new homes with state financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are desperate responses to a bleak economic situation. Prices in March were 54.7% higher than during the same month a year before. Food and drink prices rose 64% in the past 12 months. The price of mincemeat in Buenos Aires rose by a staggering 134%. The IMF expects inflation this year to be 43.7%, but some economists fear it will top 50%. The high interest rates needed to contain inflation have caused a recession. GDP, which contracted by 2.5% last year, is expected to shrink by a further 1.2% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Mr Macri has been a pro-business president, his government largely blames business for these woes. A government minister lambasted supermarkets for raising prices by up to 15% in the 48 hours before the price freezes were announced. “April, perhaps, is already lost to this inflation spiral,” he said. “If we don’t see evidence of inflation coming down in May, we will be fried.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually businesses do not raise prices out of spite. High inflation is difficult to stop once it has started because higher prices encourage demands for higher wages, which in turn force force producers to push up prices. A trigger in Argentina was a sharp decline in the value of the peso. In March the IMF warned that “breaking inflation inertia will be a lengthy process”, which will depend largely on the central bank’s control of growth in the money supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Macri government’s new tactic is unlikely to defeat inflation. Price controls on selected supermarket products imposed by the Kirchners from 2007 to 2015 had a temporary effect on overall inflation and did not tame growth in the prices of other products, according to a study by Diego Aparicio of MIT and Alberto Cavallo of Harvard University. Although the economists did not find evidence of shortages of price-controlled goods, supermarkets were able to dodge some price controls by introducing new varieties at higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF welcomed the central bank’s change to the trading range of the peso. But it is likely to take a dimmer view of the price controls. Delayed price increases for public services risk widening the budget deficit beyond the limit set by the IMF.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;But it is Argentine voters, not the IMF, whose approbation Mr Macri needs now. The latest polls suggest that he could lose to Ms Fernández, even though she has been indicted on several counts of corruption. Senior figures in his Cambiemos (Let’s Change) alliance are considering nominating someone to challenge him for the nomination to be the grouping’s presidential candidate in primaries scheduled for August. Mr Macri does not have time for the “persistence and consistency” the IMF recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 21:50:38 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[An intriguing new adaptation of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters”]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/04/18/an-intriguing-new-adaptation-of-chekhovs-three-sisters]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190420_BKP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T10:37:55Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE third act of “Three Sisters” Ivan Chebutykin, a bumbling old doctor, drunkenly knocks over a clock, smashing it to bits. In Anton Chekhov’s plays no prop is without symbolic weight, and the broken clock is a particularly rich (if unsubtle) symbol: a rupture with times past. In a new adaptation at the Almeida theatre in London, the broken clock also signifies a different kind of anachronism. Here, the &lt;em&gt;fin-de-siècle&lt;/em&gt; listlessness of Chekhov’s play is partially relocated to the present. The characters speak in a contemporary vernacular, but they exchange traditional Russian silverware and dream of a future in which “women will wear trousers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim, presumably, is to emphasise the connections between Chekhov’s time and the 21st century, and the play does have much to say to angst-ridden millennials. The young protagonists are struggling to carve out a personal and political role for themselves. They are talked down to by an older generation that dismisses their concerns as unserious and narcissistic (as Cordelia Lynn, who has written the adaptation, said in an interview: “What does that remind you of?”) Chekhov’s plot centres on the attempts of the titular siblings to work, marry or adulterate their way out of a rural backwater, where they moved from their longed-for Moscow home. When a military garrison arrives in town, bringing with it the glamorous Lieutenant-Colonel Vershinin (Peter McDonald) and Baron Tuzenbach (Shubham Saraf), the sisters see an escape route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearl Chanda, Patsy Ferran and Ria Zmitrowicz give accomplished performances as Masha, Olga and Irina Sergeyevna respectively. As the girls’ lives wear on, their ambitions are thwarted. Masha’s acid tongue and intellectual conviction give way to melancholy and malaise, even as she pursues a love affair with Vershinin. Irina’s enthusiasm for work is ground down by the mundane reality of jobs in the telegraph office and local council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odd sibling out is brother Andrey, played with despondency by Freddie Meredith. Unlike his sisters, he marries for love, to local girl Natasha Ivanovna (Lois Chimimba). But he, too, ends up desperately unhappy, abandoning his dreams of academia as his gambling addiction, his children and his unfaithful wife consume his life. As Olga, Ms Ferran has the slighter part, perhaps surprisingly given her award-winning turn in Ms Frecknall’s last Almeida production, Tennesee Williams’s “Summer and Smoke”. In that play, every scene ratchets up the tension like a coiled spring. The Chekhov is an altogether different affair: images and plotlines spark in different directions, before darkening to ash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The play works best when the pace is quick. In the first act, before the confessional speechifying gets properly underway, each scene moves energetically into the next, with most of the cast onstage. The third act injects another shot of energy, when a fire breaks out in the village. For the most part, however, the play is unavoidably cumbersome. Even as the production plays up the Beckettian verbosity, some absurdity remains. At the interval, one Almeida dramaturge commented that, had the text arrived on his desk from a new writer, he would have reached quickly for the red pen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is a thought-provoking interpretation of the material. In the production’s boldest anachronism, Chebutykin quotes T.S Eliot’s “Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock”. The poem was written 15 years after Chekhov’s death, but it is a startling prism through which to view “Three Sisters”, itself a linguistic and structural patchwork. The characters miserably measure out their lives, in coffee spoons, shot glasses or baby bottles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the great risk of staging a play about crushing ennui and profound dissatisfaction is the possibility of instilling those feelings in the audience. Despite the three-hour running time, a consistently strong cast helps this production to avoid that pitfall—narrowly. No easy answers are granted to the audience any more than to the characters. The protagonists try to escape, to advance or to return. All end up nightmarishly stuck, like the hands of a broken clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Three Sisters” is at the Almeida until June 1st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:06:27 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
