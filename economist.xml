It ended in the ransacking of a government building and tear gas. The televised chaos, including scenes of protesters violently smashing their way into and trashing the Legislative Council building, where some displayed the British and colonial-era flags, represent the latest test for Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, and for Xi Jinping, her ultimate boss in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of massive protests in recent weeks has left them searching for how best to respond to the demands of citizens of Hong Kong, who fear that their freedoms are being whittled away under Chinese rule. Opposition has been galvanised, in particular, by a bill that would make it possible for people accused of crimes in mainland China to be sent there to face trial. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 15th Ms Lam had tried to appease protesters by postponing consideration of the bill. But protesters have called for it to be withdrawn entirely. Many have also called on Ms Lam to resign. In response Hong Kong leaders have tried thus far a mixture of patience, contrition and hard-nosed police tactics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The day started with a new note of contrition from Ms Lam. The ceremony marking the 22nd anniversary of the handover was held at Hong Kong’s exhibition centre, where dignitaries watched a broadcast of the raising of the Chinese flag. In her remarks Ms Lam departed from the usual convention of opining on the progress of the city under Chinese rule, promising instead that her government would listen to the demands of the people and be more open. Meanwhile, on the streets outside, protesters were facing off with police. The contrast was stark. Television stations were using split screens to juxtapose the pomp of the ceremony with the running street battles outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At around 2pm thousands of protesters left Victoria Park as part of a police-sanctioned march through the city. This was the third huge peaceful march to take place in under a month. Whereas the others had ended at Tamar Park, home to Hong Kong’s central government offices and Legislative Council (which is known as Legco), this time organisers asked the crowds to continue westward past the government buildings. Most obeyed. But several thousand protesters, most of them younger, veered right to help form a swelling crowd around Legco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many wore masks to protect themselves from tear gas (and facial recognition technology). Some donned goggles to guard against pepper spray and helmets to protect from truncheons. Human supply chains passed along umbrellas, rolls of cling-film, cable-ties, pairs of scissors and bottles of water to the front line. Protesters uprooted metal fences from surrounding streets and dragged heavy bollards and bins to barricade the streets. Like all of the protests which have shaken the city in the past month, there was no obvious leader. Communications were shouted or conveyed by hand signals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After being criticised for using excessive force, including rubber bullets, on protesters on June 12th, Hong Kong’s police force had become more passive. By the early evening protesters had smashed large glass doors and gained access to an atrium at Legco. Metal gates inside might have stopped them there, but within hours protestors had breached that defence as well. They swiftly made their way to the council chamber, a circular room where the city’s 70 lawmakers convene. Some smashed fittings and sprayed anti-government and pro-democracy graffiti on the walls while others read out their demands, which included universal suffrage for Hong Kong. Many regard the Hong Kong government as a puppet of central-government leaders in Beijing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this leaderless movement, decisions are made collectively on the hoof, or by emotional fiat of the moment. &lt;em&gt;Apple Daily&lt;/em&gt;, a newspaper, reported that one man inside the chamber was offering protesters the choice of whether to stay or leave. Police said that they would arrest anyone who had gone inside the building. Shortly after midnight police in riot gear cleared the streets near Legco with tear gas. Protesters withdrew from the chamber before police pushed their way in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some commentators were incredulous that security services had allowed Legco to be stormed in the first place. But others mused that the violence and chaos played into the hands of the authorities.The protesters&amp;#x27; display of Hong Kong’s old colonial flag in the chamber was a symbolic rebuke of the handover 22 years ago. That sort of provocation could help the government and pro-Beijing media cast protesters in a negative light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 2nd Ms Lam held a 4am press conference in which she took a more defiant stance than in her handover speech, condemning the storming of Legco and declaring that authorities would &amp;quot;pursue any illegal acts&amp;quot; by protesters. But she also said she was willing to listen to the concerns voiced in the protests. O&lt;span&gt;rganisers say that more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;500,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; people participated&lt;/span&gt; in the protest march on July 1st. However authorities respond to the ransacking of Legco by several hundred protesters, they still must contend with millions of others in Hong Kong who have taken to the streets in recent weeks to register their dismay with the direction of their city under Chinese rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 09:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hong Kong protesters storm the legislative council]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/07/01/hong-kong-protesters-storm-the-legislative-council]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190706_CNP502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-07-01T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jul 1st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE DAY began with an official celebration of the return of Hong Kong to China on July 1st.

Since his Justice and Development (AK) party became Turkey’s dominant force in 2002, elevating Islam’s public role in this constitutionally secular republic has been more than a slogan; it has found expression in many government policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his sixteen years in power, Mr Erdogan has presided over the construction of thousands of new mosques and Islamic vocational schools, known as imam hatips. The number of students at such institutions has increased more than fivefold since 2012, to an estimated 1.4m in a country of about 80m. The budget of the religious directorate, the agency responsible for the conduct of sermons in the country’s mosques, has grown by leaps and bounds, overtaking several ministries in the process. The government has quietly cultivated relations with a number of Islamic movements and brotherhoods, helping them accumulate considerable power and wealth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But curiously these policies do not seem to have had the desired result. Turks do not appear to be any more devout than they were a decade ago, scores of Islamic schools remain empty, and the brotherhoods seem increasingly out of step with a rapidly changing society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study by KONDA, a local polling company, between 2008 and 2018 the share of Turks who define themselves as religious dipped from 55% to 51%. The number of women who wear the Islamic headscarf barely budged, from 52% a decade ago to 53%, and the share of those who fast regularly decreased from 77% to 65%. Meanwhile, the number of atheists has risen from 1% to 3%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of the money the government has poured into imam hatip schools, which combine a standard education with hours of study of Islam, supply continues to outstrip demand. At the high-school level, imam hatips filled only 52% of available places last year, compared with 95% for regular schools. Such schools are also much less successful than others. Imam hatip students are at least twice as unlikely to enrol in a university as students at regular or private schools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably the biggest brake on political Islam’s attempts to reshape Turkish society has been demography, says Bekir Agirdir, the head of KONDA. The pace of migration from the countryside to the city in Turkey has been relentless. To some extent, that has made Turkey’s urban spaces more religious and conservative in atmosphere; but over time many of the new city-dwellers tend to develop a more à la carte approach to religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of decades the percentage of Turks living in urban areas has shot up from 64% to 75%, according to the World Bank. The population of Istanbul has been expanding by an average of more than 300,000 people per year. “Urbanisation has created its own value system, as well as a big number of grey areas,” says Mr Agirdir. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many young people born into religious families are searching for an Islam compatible with modern urban life and middle-class status, he says. To make ends meet, wives and daughters who would have been confined to the home in villages and small towns go out in pursuit of work. Unmarried conservative couples attend pop concerts and embrace in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the religious brotherhoods, whatever their relationship with the government, have struggled to connect with young Muslims. What is more, all brotherhoods were cast under a shadow when members of the best-known one, led by the exiled preacher Fethullah Gulen, participated in a violent coup in July 2016. Tens of thousands of alleged and actual Gulen supporters, most of whom played no role in the coup, have been thrown into jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For at least a part of the Islamic bourgeoisie, the line separating conservative and secular lifestyles is becoming increasingly blurred, says Etyen Mahcupyan, an adviser to a former AK prime minister. This implies a more selective approach to Islam and a more limited role for the brotherhoods. “Twenty years ago, a youngster who wanted to be religious would have looked for a guide and tried to do what he was told,” he says. “But now that youngster wants to redefine Islam for himself, and no guide can do that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 03:40:34 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Japan resumes commercial whale hunting after more than 30 years]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/07/01/japan-resumes-commercial-whale-hunting-after-more-than-30-years]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190706_WOC71l.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-07-01T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jul 1st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHOULD WHALES be hunted for profit? Japan is one of a handful of countries that says yes. In December the country announced it was leaving the International Whaling Commission (IWC)—its first withdrawal from an international body since the second world war—and would no longer abide by a global moratorium imposed by the IWC in 1986. Today Japanese whaling vessels set sail to hunt whales commercially for the first time in more than three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists and whale enthusiasts may despair, but some believe Japan’s decision may in fact be a face-saving admission that its long, expensive campaign to reverse the IWC’s moratorium is over. As Patrick Ramage of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a conservation charity, recently told the Associated Press, “what we are seeing is the beginning of the end of Japanese whaling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a start, Japan will no longer send ships on “scientific” whaling expeditions to the Antarctic, a practice criticised internationally as commercial whaling in disguise. Future hunts will be restricted to Japanese waters, and within the country’s exclusive economic zone. To prevent overhunting, commercial fishermen will be subject to a quota, currently set at 227 whales through the end of the year (in 2015 Japan reported taking 520 whales).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such quotas may be unnecessary. In the mid-1960s, Japanese fishermen hauled in nearly 25,000 whales (see chart). Since then the country’s whaling industry has shrunk to just a handful of small companies employing barely 300 people. Most Japanese, outside a handful of coastal towns, have lost their appetite for whale. Annual demand for whale meat has plummeted from 200,000 to 5,000 tonnes (equivalent to roughly 40 grams per person). Much of that piles up unsold in supermarket freezers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 02:40:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Education gives Kenyan prisoners hope of redemption and release]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/07/01/education-gives-kenyan-prisoners-hope-of-redemption-and-release]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190706_MAP502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-07-01T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jul 1st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SENIOR POLICEMAN in Kenya was recently sentenced to death for torturing and killing a prisoner who had been brought into a police station near Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, for drunkenly brawling with his wife. The policeman had thrashed him with a metal pipe, dunked his head in a drum of water and then, after the man had died, claimed he had been beaten by another prisoner, who was initially charged with the murder. Bribes were offered to other prisoners to incriminate their fellow inmate. But the judge rejected the story and sentenced the cop to death.&lt;br/&gt;The police usually enjoy impunity, especially when they kill suspected criminals, which they often do, sometimes by shooting them in the back of the head after nabbing them. More striking, in this case, was that, a mere four days after he was sentenced, the errant policeman was sitting in the front row of a class of 15 prisoners in Kamiti maximum-security jail outside Nairobi. Clad in the blue and white pyjama suit worn by convicts, he had already started a course in law under the auspices of London University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the African Prisons Project (APP), a British-backed NGO, about 65 Kenyan prisoners, almost all of them lifers or on death row, are taking classes in law, their papers sent back and forth between London and Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. The scheme was started by a British lawyer, Alexander McLean, in neighbouring Uganda 12 years ago. In Kamiti prisoners and warders often attend class together, sometimes helping each other with homework or jointly solving legal conundrums. “We’ve had so many success stories,” says George Dianga, the officer in charge of Kamiti. “APP has greatly improved the inmates’ capacity to make appeals. Now judges really do listen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APP has even helped change the law itself. One of its star students, Wilson Kinyua, who was set free in February after 19 years behind bars, had argued before the Supreme Court that the death penalty violated the constitution, which forbids cruel or inhumane punishment. In fact, no death sentence has been carried out in Kenya since 1987; thousands have had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment under presidential decrees. But the death penalty is still on the statute book. Thanks, however, to the constitutional challenge lodged by Mr Kinyua and his friends, the Supreme Court now accepts that death sentences should no longer be mandatory for murder (the recent case of the policeman was considered exceptionally heinous).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law in Kenya is still heavily tilted against the poor, who are afforded no legal aid in their defence, except for capital crimes, unless a lawyer can be found who acts pro bono. Travesties of justice are frequent. Until the recent Supreme Court ruling, judges had little leeway to be lenient since various crimes carried mandatory sentences. Robbery with violence, for instance, used to carry a mandatory sentence of death, albeit often commuted to life. But life usually meant life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the women prisoners serving life or facing a death sentence in the maximum security jail in Langata, on the other side of Nairobi from Kamiti, murdered their husbands or partners. Yet their standard claim that they suffered violent domestic abuse carried little extenuating weight when judges sentenced them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a key facet of the APP has been to teach prisoners how to launch appeals and to argue for them in court. The prisoners pursuing London University courses stress that their aim is to help fellow inmates who were unable, for lack of education or money, effectively to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the APP is sensitive to the charge of paternalistic interference in Kenya’s judicial system, the Kenyan government and especially its prison service have been happy to co-operate with it. The APP has sought to improve both prison conditions and the justice system itself. One effect has been to reduce the number of prisoners, nearly half of whom are on remand. Another is to warm relations between prisoners and their guards. And another is to lessen reoffending: according to the APP, none of its graduates, once freed, has slipped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, it has given prisoners hope. “APP has inspired us,” says William, a death-row prisoner who, after ten years inside, has both a poetic and lawyerly turn of phrase. “It has turned people from being unreasonable into being reasonable. Inasmuch our bodies are in prison, our minds are free. And we have minds that can move mountains.” Even the APP’s latest death-row student, the cop who tortured and murdered a prisoner, can hope for eventual redemption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 02:40:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The singular genius of Pauline Kael]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/07/01/the-singular-genius-of-pauline-kael]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190706_BKP502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-07-01T15:38:39Z&quot;&gt;Jul 1st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAULINE KAEL, the legendary film critic for the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, would have turned 100 last month (she died in 2001). As part of the centenary celebrations an admiring and buoyant documentary, “What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael”, was shown at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film makes it clear that Kael (pictured left) was the most influential critic in the history of the medium. And that she always will be: no other film writer can ever have the same impact she had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partly this is because she was the funniest, the most combative, the most erudite and the most enthusiastic writer in the business (and that is the kind of hyperbole she enjoyed using herself). She expunged “term-paper pomposity” from her reviews, distancing herself from aloof “gentleman critics” by balancing her encyclopedic film knowledge with proudly subjective opinions, autobiographical tidbits, dirty jokes and remarks she overheard from other patrons in the cinema. Although her acidic wit was compared to Dorothy Parker’s, she saw herself as an outsider in New York and in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;. A California rancher’s daughter, she was accused by a colleague of “trampling through the pages of the magazine with cowboy boots covered with dung”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partly, though, Kael’s pre-eminence was a matter of timing. She was old enough to remember seeing silent movies with her parents in the 1920s, and yet she didn’t join the staff of the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; until 1968, when she was nearly 50. Prior to that, she had lurched from magazine to magazine, struggling to make a living. The problem was that she despised Hollywood’s big-budget crowd-pleasers, panning the likes of “The Sound of Music” as being overblown and sentimental. “American movies have never been more contemptible,” she declared in 1967, a stance that did not endear her to her editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 1967 was also the year when Arthur Penn’s controversially bloody “Bonnie and Clyde” was released. Most critics loathed or ignore it, but Kael was infatuated, and her 9,000-word defence of the outlaw biopic earned her a position at the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;. Suddenly, a generation of American film-makers was experimenting with the iconoclastic “New Wave” techniques of Europe’s auteurs—and Kael loved them. In particular, she loved the sex, the violence and the exploding heads she saw in the work of Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman. There was none of that in “The Sound of Music”. And so it came about that a middle-aged single mother became a best-selling pundit by championing America’s youngest, hippest male directors. She made their careers, and they made hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What She Said” may not be particularly iconoclastic, but it is a lively, exhaustively researched, and stunningly well edited tribute to an uncompromising talent. Written and directed by Rob Garver, the documentary compiles excerpts from Kael’s journalism (read by Sarah Jessica Parker), hundreds of film clips and snippets of interviews with figures such as Camille Paglia, Paul Schrader, Quentin Tarantino, David O Russell and others. John Boorman, an English film-maker, recalls that when Kael was at her formidable peak, directors felt as if they were “under surveillance”. Ridley Scott is still angry about her dismissal of “Blade Runner” in 1982. On a chat show in 1973 Jerry Lewis, “The King of Comedy”, said that Kael was a “dirty old broad” who “never said a good word about me.” “But she’s probably the most qualified critic in the world”, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just think about that: a film star praising a film critic on television and assuming that the audience would know who he was talking about. It would never happen now. In the modern, fragmented, cultural landscape, cinephiles no longer queue up to buy magazines which run 9,000-word essays by their favourite critics—they harvest opinions from countless blogs, tweets and podcasts instead. In the unlikely event that a 21st-century reviewer could write as scintillatingly as Kael did, and that she had a movement as inspiring as the American New Wave to write about, most people would still have no idea who she was or what she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 23:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wanted: a new writer to cover British economics]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/01/wanted-a-new-writer-to-cover-british-economics]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/20180224_wop001_9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-07-01T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jul 1st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; is looking to hire a staff writer to cover British economics.

Each year since 2011, the Federal Reserve has set “stress tests” for the banks. They must show how much capital they have, the quality of that capital and what activities they are up to. The Fed uses this evidence to determine whether an adverse shock—economic, financial or otherwise—might put too large a dent in that capital. The tests are one feature of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank financial-reform act, and they aim to ensure that lenders have enough equity on hand should catastrophe strike again. Failure to measure up can result in the Fed curtailing a bank’s ability to distribute cash to shareholders, in the form of dividends or share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 21st the Fed announced that America’s banks passed this year’s tests with flying colours. That paves the way for bumper payouts to shareholders. The four largest retail banks, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, plus the two biggest investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, purchased $93.1bn-worth of their own stock in 2018. That will rise to $117.9bn in 2019. Most banks have also raised their planned distribution of dividends by more than 10%. On June 27th the Fed approved these capital plans for America’s 18 largest banks (though their approval for Credit Suisse is conditional on the bank addressing what the regulator regarded as weaknesses in its plans for share repurchases and dividends).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one way, the stress tests were tougher than ever before. The worst hypothetical shock this year included a global recession in which American unemployment rises to 10%, accompanied by sliding property prices and stressed corporate-debt markets. Even under this scenario banks would hold more capital than the Fed’s minimum requirement (although only just in the cases of JPMorgan Chase and Capital One). Randal Quarles, who oversees bank regulation at the Fed, said that “the results confirm that our financial system remains resilient”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are fears that the Fed made the tests easier in other ways. A smaller cohort of banks—just the very biggest—was tested this year, following a roll-back of Dodd-Frank passed by Congress in 2018 which meant smaller banks need not be tested every year. And banks were also given more information about how the test would be conducted. In previous years they had received details only about the catastrophic scenarios, not about the models the Fed would use to test them. Banks had complained that this made their task akin to trying to hit a moving target in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Tarullo, a former Fed governor who stepped down in 2017 and who designed the Fed’s stress tests, had been wary of divulging more information. He feared banks would rearrange their balance-sheets merely to meet the test, and argued that publishing the Fed’s models would “result in less protection for the financial system”. Mr Quarles has a different opinion. He has said the change is akin to “giving banks the textbook—not the test”. The Fed published “enhanced descriptions” of the models it uses in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year the tests may be changed more radically yet. On July 9th the Fed is hosting a conference in Boston to review the stress-testing procedures. Many in the industry suspect that it will say it intends to adopt a new test, the “stress capital buffer”, alongside stress tests. Currently, passing the stress test requires that a bank’s common-equity “Tier 1” capital ratio—a measure of its equity—does not dip below 4.5% in the worst scenario the Fed examines. Proving this requires banks to outline their planned dividend repurchases and share buybacks a year in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stress capital buffer would use the results of the stress test to designate a minimum common-equity Tier 1 ratio for rest of the year. The buffer would be calculated as the difference between a firm’s common-equity Tier 1 ratio at present—and what it would hypothetically fall to under the worst scenario tested. Goldman Sachs’s common-equity Tier 1 capital ratio is 13.3% at present, for example, but would be just 6.7% under the worst scenario. Its stress capital buffer would be 6.6%, the difference between the two. The total common-equity Tier 1 capital ratio the bank would need to maintain year-round would therefore be the minimum (4.5%), plus its stress capital buffer and a surcharge for being big and systemically important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks with stable businesses are largely in favour of the change, as it would allow them to vary their dividends and buybacks through the year—as most companies do—rather than outlining plans in advance. But the new procedure would most affect banks that undertake risky, volatile activities, which might see their capital requirements vary wildly with the economic cycle. Although most would end up having to hold roughly the same amount of capital as now, those with large trading business, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, might have to raise more capital in the future. The goal might be a wise one, however. Passing one stress test is well and good, but what the Fed really wants is for them to be passed with flying colours year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 21:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“You smell the tear gas, you can smell the blood”—Sudan’s violent transition]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/07/01/you-smell-the-tear-gas-you-can-smell-the-blood-sudans-violent-transition]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190706_blm501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-07-01T11:23:25Z&quot;&gt;Jul 1st 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROTESTORS RETURNED to the streets of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/06/15/how-to-stop-sudan-sliding-into-war&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khartoum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, again with deadly consequences.

Leaders gathered on June 30th to thrash out a deal on the EU’s big jobs: the presidents of the European Commission (the EU&amp;#x27;s executive), the European Council (representing leaders), the European Parliament and the High Representative for foreign affairs and security policy. The presidency of the European Central Bank, which will also soon be vacant, is also in the mix as leaders strive for regional and political balance. At the time of writing, they were still deliberating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blockage concerns a provisional package of appointments sketched out by the leaders of France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands on the fringes of the G20 summit in Osaka. This would allocate the commission presidency to Frans Timmermans (pictured), a Dutch Social Democrat, the council presidency to a liberal like Charles Michel of Belgium and the parliament presidency to Manfred Weber, a Christian Democrat from Germany whose bid for the commission job has met with opposition from President Emmanuel Macron of France and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This accord has come under intense pressure at the summit. Leaders from the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right group to which Mr Weber and Angela Merkel belong, reckon the parliament presidency too puny a prize for coming first in the European elections. They want the commission. Central European governments like that of Poland also object to Mr Timmermans, who as vice-president of the outgoing commission has been a sturdy opponent of illiberalism in the region. Southerners were also aggrieved at their lack of representation—noting that the Osaka proposal would put figures from the Benelux countries in the two most powerful presidencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objections began at the EPP’s pre-summit meeting yesterday afternoon, when leaders made known their objections to Mrs Merkel’s plan. The German chancellor left early for one-on-one consultations. All of which delayed the start of the summit&amp;#x27;s official dinner last night. Then, around 10pm, Donald Tusk, the outgoing council president, suspended the group discussion to hold a series of bilateral meetings before the leaders reconvened for breakfast at 7am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various packages were floated through the night. One option would see a compromise EPP figure like Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, clinch the commission presidency. But that would break the doctrine (albeit one established only in 2014) whereby a Spitzenkandidat or “lead candidate” of a major parliamentary group during the European election campaign takes that job. Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans were both lead candidates; Mr Barnier was not. The latest permutation under discussion would send Mr Timmermans to the commission and Kristalina Georgieva, the Bulgarian head of the World Bank, to the helm of the council, with Mr Weber as parliament president and Mr Michel as High Representative. Ms Georgieva is highly rated and might satisfy the central Europeans, but has never served as a head of government—which is generally viewed as a requirement for the council job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the allocation of posts is proving so fraught says something about the state of Europe. There was always intense horse-trading over the big jobs, but in the past it was often squared by grand bargains between France and Germany and between Christian and Social Democrats. Today’s EU is a more multi-dimensional one. The parliament and the European Council are more politically fragmented. France and Germany are at odds and in any case less powerful collectively. After the euro and migrant crises, and amid debates about liberal democracy, regional sensitivities are more raw. Mrs Merkel, once the EU’s leading co-ordinating force, is nearing the end of her time as chancellor; she seems to have misread the mood in her own EPP. The great European Rubik’s cube has more colours and layers than before. Aligning them takes time. So much so that some are already mooting a further summit on July 15th if no agreement can be reached today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 18:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
