Corporate executives, particularly in America, seem to take a similar attitude towards their shareholders, believing that, like children, they should be seen but definitely not heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe managers should get their fingers out of their ears and start listening to their investors. That is the conclusion of a recent paper* by Clifford Holderness of the Carroll School of Management at Boston College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In America and a few other countries, boards can issue additional shares without shareholder approval. In some countries, shareholders must approve issuance above a certain threshold. And in yet others, investors must agree before any new stock can be created. So what happens to a company’s share price when new shares are issued? Mr Holderness performed a meta-analysis of more than 100 studies of stock reactions around the world. He found that, when shareholders approved issuance in advance, the price tended to rise by an average of 2%. But when managers issued stock without shareholder approval, the share price declined by an average of 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest explanation for this differential lies in the agent-principal conflict between executives and investors. As Mr Holderness writes, if agency conflicts did not exist, “shareholder voting on equity issuance should not matter.” However, managers may want to issue shares to fund expansion of the company, allowing them to control more assets and demand a higher salary. Investors, meanwhile, may worry about the impact of such expansion on long-term returns and dislike the dilution of their control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign of agent-principal conflicts are shares that are privately placed with selected investors or used to pay for takeovers. In Australia, any offering of more than 15% of the equity must be subject to shareholder approval; in America, the threshold is 20%. In both countries, there is a clustering of share issuance just below the limit; managers go out of their way to avoid asking for approval. In April Occidental Petroleum promised $10bn worth of preferred shares to Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s conglomerate, should the oil company’s bid for Anadarko, a rival, succeed. This injection helped it avoid asking shareholders to authorise the Anadarko deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disdain for shareholders’ views contradicts the ethos of American capitalism. The system works, it is usually argued, because companies respond to shareholder pressure and because broad share ownership gives everyone, including workers, a stake in the American dream. One of the reasons for the success of the private-equity model is that investors enjoy greater scrutiny over what managers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to public companies, shareholders tend to be treated like an awkward uncle at a family gathering. Their only rights are to sell their shares or to vote against the reappointment of directors. In any other field, this would be extraordinary. Imagine you appointed a letting agent to look after your house and they decided to spend lots of your money on gold taps and chandeliers. When you complain, they respond that you are only entitled to sell the house, or fire them at the end of their contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managers have long grumbled that shareholders want to interfere too much. A new complaint is that socially conscious investors may insist that firms concentrate on non-financial factors, like treating workers better or cutting emissions. This concern seems ill-founded. For example, research** shows that companies voted the “best to work for” produce superior subsequent long-term returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More generally, the majority of metastudies have found that companies with better ESG (environmental, social and governance) records improved their financial performance. Mr Holderness’s work puts the tin lid on the argument that managers should ignore investors. When it comes to shareholders, managers should remember the words of Diogenes: “We have two ears and one tongue so that we would listen more and talk less.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* “Equity issuances and agency costs: The telling story of shareholder approval around the world”, &lt;em&gt;Journal of Financial Economics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** “Employee Satisfaction, Labor Market Flexibility, and Stock Returns Around the World”, by Alex Edmans, Lucius Li and Chendi Zhang, European Corporate Governance Institute Working Paper 433&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，被墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;新增&lt;a href="https://feedx.net/needhelp" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;“帮你做个RSS”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 17:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The world ahead: food for thought]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/27/the-world-ahead-food-for-thought]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/the_world_ahead_podcast_banner_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-27T18:30:25Z&quot;&gt;May 27th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFTER THE successful &lt;strong&gt;stockmarket flotation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/01/can-the-veggie-burger-company-change-eating-habits-before-it-goes-bust&quot;&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, maker of the Beyond Burger, we assess the potential impact of meat substitutes on &lt;strong&gt;global meat consumption&lt;/strong&gt;.

Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (whose chairman, John Elkann, sits on the board of &lt;em&gt;The Economist’&lt;/em&gt;s parent company) are hoping to convince investors that the same is true of carmakers themselves. On May 27th the Italian-American FCA confirmed rumours that it was seeking a merger with its French counterpart, itself part of a close alliance with Japan’s Nissan and Mitsubishi. If a deal goes ahead it will create an automotive colossus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the two companies currently sell nearly 9m cars a year for €170bn ($190bn), generating an operating profit of around €10bn. That alone would put the combined firm in third place behind only Toyota and Volkswagen (VW), each of which produces around 10m cars annually. Add in Renault’s alliance partners, however, and the new group’s combined total of 15m cars would leave everyone else in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The putative deal can be seen as the legacy of two fallen giants of carmaking. Sergio Marchionne, FCA’s storied boss who died last year, had called for consolidation of the mass market, where slender profits are partly the result of duplicated investment in similar technologies such as engines that do little to differentiate brands. FCA has long displayed a “for sale” sign on its windscreen. The architect of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, Carlos Ghosn, had his plans for world domination stymied by his arrest and detention in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing at Nissan (he denies the charges). Mr Ghosn had previously invited FCA to join the alliance, to no avail. Both Marchionne and Mr Ghosn would no doubt have coveted the driver’s seat of the merged firm. Neither Mike Manley, FCA’s newish chief executive, nor Thierry Bolloré, his counterpart at Renault, seems to possess their predecessors’ rampant egos that may have prevented a deal in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of the two firms looks good on paper. The scale that Marchionne talked about and Mr Ghosn built through his Franco-Japanese alliance was a sensible reaction to the challenges of the industry. It helps firms ride out economic downturns and spread investments in electric vehicles (EVs), self-driving cars and mobility services (such as ride-hailing and car-sharing beloved of younger car users) across more vehicles. FCA estimates that joint development of engines, EVs and platforms on which all cars are built will save €5bn a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two firms also plug gaps in each other’s businesses both geographically and in terms of products. FCA’s strength and profits come from America and Renault’s from Europe. The French firm’s cheap models and EV know-how will complement FCA’s pick-ups and premium brands such as Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the tie-up defy the patchy history of automotive megadeals? The list of failures is long: Daimler and Chrysler, BMW and Rover, GM and Fiat, anything to do with Ford. Both FCA and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi have succeeded in part thanks to those exceptional former bosses, and partly because they avoided full-blown integration. FCA has flourished because Fiat and Chrysler have remained largely apart. So have component parts of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, a looser structure which falls short of a full merger but whose pace of cost savings has been sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FCA makes it clear that its deal is with Renault but also that it sees “significant expected benefits to all parties from the expanded partnership”. That partnership is looking creaky in the aftermath of Mr Ghosn’s arrest, which he claims was orchestrated by Nissan in order to prevent his plans for a full merger. Nissan denies this. Nissan may also be reluctant to continue collaborating with Renault once it merges with FCA, which competes with the Japanese firm in America&amp;#x27;s lucrative pick-up market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running an alliance that makes 15m cars would also be hard. Mr Ghosn claimed, with some justification, that he alone had the skills to run an unwieldy entity that churned out 10m cars a year. After Marchionne’s death such boasts rang even truer. The difficulties of VW, with its garage-ful of brands, suggest that it does take a special talent. The deal, to be structured as a 50-50 partnership in proportion to existing stakes in either firm, would hand the largest single stake to Exor, the investment vehicle of Fiat’s founding Agnelli family which controls FCA through a 29% stake. The French state, which owns 15% of Renault, will apparently give up its double voting rights and accept a board made up mainly of independent directors (FCA has promised that no factories will close, in France or elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renault’s board, which was due to meet on May 27th, still has to sign off on the deal. So do competition authorities in Europe and America. And if scale at the top of the industry moves from 10m to 15m cars a year, will others seek to replicate it? Ford and VW are in a partnership that some say could tighten. PSA, which makes Peugeots and Citroëns, is open to offers. China’s government is perpetually rumoured to be planning a merger of its biggest state-run firms. Messrs Ghosn and Marchionne may be out of the running, but their dream rides on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 02:40:14 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Increasing access to abortions may have reduced America’s crime rate]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/27/increasing-access-to-abortions-may-have-reduced-americas-crime-rate]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190601_woc138.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-27T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 27th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANTI-ABORTION POLICIES are on the rise in America. Influenced mainly by objections from religious conservatives, legislators in states such as Georgia, Ohio and Alabama have passed new laws limiting the practice. In some instances, the new regulations go so far as to ban abortions even in cases of rape or incest—a measure supported by just 11% of voters, according to Morning Consult, a pollster. Restricting access to abortions means that more parents who don’t want to raise children would be forced to do so. Recent research suggests this could reverse decades of progress made on curbing crime in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in 2001, the economists John Donahue and Steven Levitt credited the legalisation of abortion across America with much of the subsequent reduction in crime in the country. They argued that violent crime in states where abortion had been banned before 1973 was 15-25% rarer in 1997 than it would have been had abortion remained illegal. The study was politically explosive, and widely criticised. Many sceptical scholars sought to poke holes in its methods, including one group who discovered an “inadvertent but serious computer programming error” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2005/12/01/oops-onomics&quot;&gt;see article&lt;/a&gt;) underlying its findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two decades later, Messrs Donahue and Levitt have returned to the subject, and present new evidence that bolsters their original claim. In a new working paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they attribute a whopping 45 percentage points of the total 50% decline in crime since 1990 to legal abortion. Their primary evidence is that crime fell much faster in states where more abortions were performed than it did in those where the procedure was rarer. In the early 1990s violent crime was about 50% more common in states with relatively high abortion levels than it was in those where abortion was infrequent. By 2014, crime rates in the two groups of states had converged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors argue that this statistical association reflects an underlying causal relationship. Armed with a cache of annual state-level data on abortions, crime rates and other factors—including economic conditions, welfare payments, access to firearms and alcohol consumption—they seek to isolate the impact of abortion on violent crime, after controlling for other variables that also affect crime rates. With all other factors held constant, they find that an increase in the abortion rate of 100 per 100,000 births leads to a 10-20% reduction in crime. Past studies have also shown that children born to women who wanted an abortion but did not receive one were much more likely to become criminals and had poorer life prospects than those who were born to parents ready and willing to raise them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2019 23:40:15 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Conservatives and Labour take a bashing in Britain’s European election]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/27/the-conservatives-and-labour-take-a-bashing-in-britains-european-election]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190601_blp904.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-27T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 27th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE ONLY fair conclusion from the European election in Britain is that the country is still split down the middle over Brexit. On a total turnout of around 37%, slightly higher than in 2014, Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party was the biggest winner, taking some 32% of the vote and 28 seats. Adding in the remnant UK Independence Party took the two clearest pro-Brexit parties to a vote share of 35%. Mr Farage immediately claimed that voters were telling politicians that they wanted Brexit to happen without a deal on October 31st, the current departure date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet if strong Leavers had a good night, so did strong Remainers. The Liberal Democrats got 20% of the vote, giving them 15 seats, and the Green Party 12% of the vote and seven seats. Adding in the new Change UK party, which had a bad night, and the Scottish and Welsh nationalists takes the combined score of pro-Remain and pro-second-referendum parties to almost 40%, well ahead of the two pro-no-deal parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest losers in the election were the Conservatives and Labour. The combined vote share of what are traditionally known as the two main parties fell to just 23%, down from 82% in the 2017 general election and less than half their share in the previous European one. The Tories had a truly shocking night. Their vote collapsed to just 9% and they won only three seats. Clearly many Tory voters, disappointed that Brexit has not happened yet, so necessitating this election, deserted to back Mr Farage’s Brexit Party (while many Tory Remainers fled to the Liberal Democrats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Labour did only a little better, with 14% of the vote and ten seats. The party suffered from what voters saw as its ambiguous position on Brexit, with insufficient clarity over whether it wants a second referendum or which side it would support if there were one. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, promised to reflect on the result and hinted more strongly than before that he might come round more explicitly to supporting another Brexit referendum, though not all his advisers agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger question is what impact this election will have on the contest to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister, which will formally get under way on June 10th. Some Conservative MPs were quick to conclude that the party must now embrace a no-deal Brexit, so as to fend off Mr Farage. His strong showing should thus boost the leadership hopes of the frontrunner, Boris Johnson, who has promised that Brexit will happen on October 31st with or without a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet other Tories remain fearful of the consequences of crashing out of the European Union without a deal in October. They say there is no sign that Brussels will agree to make any big concessions to an incoming pro-Brexit prime minister, which might mean that it will be necessary to ask for a further extension of the Brexit deadline. Rory Stewart, another leadership candidate, has already said that he would not serve under Mr Johnson if the latter embraced no-deal. Other Tories think the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if a new Tory leader seeks to outdo Mr Farage by backing a no-deal Brexit, he or she may be unable to secure a parliamentary majority. And that brings the country back where it started: still sharply divided over Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2019 19:40:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Populists fall short of expectations in the European elections]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/26/populists-fall-short-of-expectations-in-the-european-elections]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_blp903.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-26T22:26:45Z&quot;&gt;May 26th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THAT right-wing populism has gained ground in Europe in recent years is a well-established fact. A glance at the continent&amp;#x27;s recent electoral history shows that much: the Lega dominates Italy’s politics, Marine Le Pen made it to the run-off of the French presidential election in 2017, Law and Justice (PiS) runs Poland and elsewhere smaller parties from Alternative for Germany to the Danish People’s Party and Vox in Spain are shaping their countries’ politics. All of which is a far cry from the settled European party landscape of 15 or 20 years ago. But that much is known. The question now is: in what direction is European politics moving and at what pace?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evening’s result in the European elections provides some answers to that, and caveat the more excitable commentaries about the rise of nationalists in Europe. Turnout is up for the first time ever, and at 51% higher than in any European election since 1994. And yes, the right-populists have done well again. The Lega is first in Italy, Ms Le Pen’s National Rally has narrowly beaten Emmanuel Macron to first place in France, PiS came first in Poland despite running against a mostly unified opposition ticket. But it is also clear that the mighty, breakneck populist surge of a couple of years ago—with Britain voting to leave the EU, populists topping polls all over the continent and a cataclysmic nationalist takeover threatening—is over. Nationalists are now consolidating their gains and settling into a much broader pattern: that of fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the numbers. Ms Le Pen’s result is down on 2014, the previous European election. So is the Austrian Freedom Party and, more drastically, the Danish People’s Party and the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands. It is true that some of the latter’s support has switched to Forum for Democracy, a rival right-populist outfit. But this too underperformed expectations and the overall seat-share of Dutch Eurosceptics has halved. Alternative for Germany also disappointed its boosters: on 10.8% it only modestly increased its support on 2014 and did less well than in the 2017 Bundestag election. The Lega has made big gains, but it too seems to have done worse than was generally expected and its wins only just make up for losses elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall the three Eurosceptic or hard-right groups in the European Parliament have, according to the parliament’s own projection, increased their seat share from 21% to 23%. Hardly a surge and oddly static after five years that have seen Europe face a migration crisis, the Brexit vote, terror attacks and the wholesale fragmentation of the continent’s politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of that fragmentation there was much more evidence. The Green group is projected to swell in size from 52 seats to 70 seats, thanks especially to the German Green party’s 21% showing (taking second place and overtaking the doughty Social Democrats to become the largest party on the German left). The centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will grow from 69 to a projected 101 seats, with Mr Macron’s Renaissance joining and immediately becoming its largest member. Meanwhile the two big losers are the big-tent party families that have together run Europe as an informal “grand coalition”: the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;amp;D). Their joint tally falls from 401 seats (54%) to a projected 325 seats (43%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fact will shape the next European Parliament. For one thing, the EPP and S&amp;amp;D have lost their majority. Expect more ad hoc coalitions around case-by-case issues. And where a “grand coalition” of the centre is needed—on the upcoming approval of a new European Commission president, for example—it will have to be much broader than before and draw in liberals and even greens. The old two-party establishment has become at least a three-and-a-half-party establishment. And it is looking much less established, in any case. European politics is churning, splitting and recombining in new ways and directions. The long-term rise of the right-wing populists is part of that but not, in this election, a particularly new or dynamic one. Tonight’s crucial trend is not a populist surge but the revelation of the full scale of Europe’s political fragmentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2019 07:18:00 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The case for Margrethe Vestager]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/25/the-case-for-margrethe-vestager]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_blp901.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-25T20:09:25Z&quot;&gt;May 25th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EUROPEAN POLITICS is a febrile place. The old centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and the old centre-left Party of European Socialists (PES) have long dominated the continent’s politics but are now ceding their dominance. Tomorrow’s European election results will probably show that the two are the big losers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who should replace them? Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right leader, will marshal a nationalist right-wing party. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, will try to found a liberal pro-European force. Neither will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream national leaders will want a figure who can get things done, who is acceptable to the centre-right European People’s Party; to the centre-left Party of European Socialists and possibly to liberal and green camps. They will look for someone who crosses old ideological boundaries and who can make Europe relevant at a time when the continent is declining in global significance. They will stumble upon Margrethe Vestager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Vestager has served as education, interior and economy minister of Denmark despite belonging to a tiny left-liberal party. As European Commissioner since 2014 she has applied both a liberal sense of consumer rights and a centre-left commitment to defending the little guy to the task of regulating technology giants. She has taken on tax dodgers, infringers of personal privacy and market distorters and defeated them all. Thrusting machos from Silicon Valley have turned up in her office, berated her and come off the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU in 2019 faces an array of security and economic threats. It needs a powerful, efficient leader with experience of the Commission and a sense of how the world is changing. It needs a leader who can stand up for Europe and initiate legislation defending its citizens. It needs someone acceptable to left and right, north and south. Many candidates will put their names forward. Ms Vestager ticks all the boxes. Europe would be foolish to overlook her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2019 05:40:12 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Onward Christian soldiers]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/05/25/onward-christian-soldiers]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_BLP508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-25T20:30:00Z&quot;&gt;May 25th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF ALL THE people involved were civilians, there would be nothing especially controversial about a popular website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://prayatlunch.us/&quot;&gt;PLUS&lt;/a&gt;, which invites American Christians to “pray at lunchtime for the United States”. But the site’s main author, John Teichert, describes himself as an “active duty brigadier-general who has served in the United States Air Force” since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For critics like Mikey Weinstein, president of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/&quot;&gt;Military Religious Freedom Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (MRFF), which campaigns for church-state separation in the armed forces, this sort of thing epitomises an ever-escalating trend. In the era of Donald Trump, they allege, fundamentalist Christians in uniform have felt freer than ever to test the boundaries set by the constitution and take advantage of their rank when disseminating their own reading of their faith and of American history. The MRFF is not alone in this complaint: last year, at least two other secularist groups formally protested to the Pentagon over the fact that service personnel were being bamboozled into attending religious ceremonies, compromising their own religious freedom.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In several ways, the PLUS website is carefully crafted. It offers the disclaimer that “the views presented are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of the Department of Defence or its components.” The reference to lunch suggests that people are not being asked to give up professional time. The author’s surname is not given, although it is an open secret. The Pentagon has defended the website as a legitimate use of spare time by the officer. On the other hand, as commander of fighter-aircraft testing at Edwards Air Force Base, a giant facility in California, the brigadier-general enjoys huge personal authority and charisma. The MRFF says it is continuing to complain about his site, despite repeated rebuffs from the Pentagon, at the urging of at least 40 service personnel, including believing Christians who say they feel intimidated by the knowledge that one of their commanders is propagating one particular version of the faith.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Weinstein describes this version as “dominionist” Christianity, the idea that earthly institutions should be harnessed to spread the Christian cause. This often goes hand in hand with a particular interpretation of America’s earliest years, which insists that the founding fathers planned to establish a Christian nation, not a religiously neutral one. (Secularist historians disagree.) The PLUS website urges followers to pray for America &amp;quot;to return to its biblical foundation&amp;quot;. It also advocates prayers for &amp;quot;Bible-preaching churches, pastors and missionaries&amp;quot;, in language often used by non-conformist Christians to differentiate themselves from, say, Catholics who stress the authority of the church as opposed to the Bible alone. Further supplications are proposed for the unborn and for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In years past, Mr Weinstein says, this way of thinking was especially prevalent in the Air Force, but now he says he observes it in all branches of the American services. He finds it widespread in elite special-forces units, such as the Navy Seals. “The closer you get to the tip of the spear, the more dominionist thinking there is.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he uses the term, dominionist Christians should be distinguished carefully from evangelicals, although the two categories do overlap. Many evangelical Christians fully respect the principle of church-state separation and correspondingly keep their faith and its propagation within boundaries that are designed to respect the freedom of others. Among the 60,000 or so supporters of the MRFF, there are many evangelicals, according to Mr Weinstein. Some turn to the MRFF because they feel bullied over religious matters by commanders or chaplains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 3,000 chaplains serve the American forces. The overwhelming majority are Protestant, and only a handful cater to minority faiths such as Judaism, Hinduism and Islam. Within the Protestant contingent, a vocal subset make no secret of the fact that they regard chaplaincy as an opportunity for missionary work, rather than for catering to those who already profess their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in many areas of American life, managing religious affairs in the armed forces will always involve a careful equilibrium between two principles enshrined in the constitution’s First Amendment: the free exercise of faith, and a bar on the state establishment of any particular religion. In that spirit, an official instruction to Air Force officers tells them to:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…balance constitutional protections, for their own free exercise of religion, including individual expressions of religious beliefs, and the constitutional prohibition against governmental establishment of religion…They must ensure their words and actions cannot reasonably be construed to be official endorsing or disapproving of, or extending preferential treatment for any faith, belief, or absence of belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to imply that officers should never use their professional time, their work e-mail accounts or the authority of their rank to spread one particular idea about religion. But in practice this principle is widely violated, complains Mr Weinstein, himself a retired Air Force officer.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one example he offers, a recent legal determination by the Pentagon, winkled out by the MRFF, lays down what officers can say at change-of-command ceremonies or personal promotion celebrations. In rather surreal language, it says that in the former kind of ritual, commanders may “briefly thank a Supreme Being (either generally, such as Providence, that Almighty Being, our Lord, or the Supreme Author of All Good; or specifically, such as Allah, Brahman, Christ, Ganesh, God, Yahweh, or even Beelzebub)”. A celebrant may also be invited to offer a prayer to one of these beings.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Weinstein and his supporters believe that these concessions to expressions of faith by commanders are mistaken. The promotion ceremony, while regarded as an individual milestone, is nonetheless conducted in uniform, he observes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, whatever the successes chalked up by the perceived dominionists, there are some countervailing trends in the armed forces. One is the increasing acceptance of LGBT service personnel and same-sex relationships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015 it was announced that the armed forces&amp;#x27; equal-opportunity policies applied to gays and lesbians. Two years ago a married lesbian woman, Kristin Goodwin, was named as commandant of cadets at the US Air Force Academy. Religious conservatives grumbled that to have got so far, she could not have been honest about her sexual orientation during her early career. (In fact, the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which military authorities applied in relation to sexuality between 1994 and 2011, would have spared her any difficult questions.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month it was announced that Brigadier-General Goodwin had been removed from her post, pending the investigation of a complaint about which no details have been disclosed. There is no suggestion whatever that her sexual orientation was the basis of that complaint, but her removal was announced prominently on religious conservative websites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As America prepares for Memorial Day commemorations of its war dead on May 27th, it is fair to say that battles over religion and culture are raging deep inside the armed forces, as in so many other arenas. And for what it may be worth, Brigadier-General Teichert has added Mr Weinstein to the list of people in need of those lunch-time prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2019 03:40:43 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[American history in black and white]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/news/2019/05/25/american-history-in-black-and-white]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_opp507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-25T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 25th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEW COUNTRIES erect monuments to their failed secessionist movements, particularly those premised on the right to enslave people. But, then, America is an exceptional country. Many American cities and states are debating the propriety of monuments to the Confederacy—the band of southern states that fought a civil war over the right to maintain slaves. In few places is the controversy so searing as in Montgomery, the state capital of Alabama. This had served as the confederate capital before it was moved to Richmond, Virginia, a few months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I visited Montgomery to report on poverty in the Black Belt—the fertile region just south and west of the city once filled with vast cotton plantations worked by slaves. After the civil war, which the South lost, things improved only marginally for rural blacks. New forms of subjugation took the place of slavery: sharecropping; the indentured labour of prisoners; lynching; the suppression of black voters; and racial segregation. Alabama was at the forefront of all these. In the Black Belt I interviewed descendants of slaves who were living without proper sanitation, with untreated sewage draining into their backyards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is no accident that Montgomery was a focal point of the civil-rights movement in the 1960s. It is where Martin Luther King Jr preached, where Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat and one of the places where Freedom Riders were viciously attacked when they challenged segregation on buses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, known as the national lynching memorial, is a powerful testament to the racial brutality endured by blacks well after the civil war. Lynching was tolerated and sometimes abetted by local officials, and watched by crowds of thousands for sheer entertainment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The memorial documents 4,400 people killed. Their names are etched on large iron steles, some suspended from a roof, others laid on the ground stretching far into the distance. The identities of many more victims are unknown. The site’s museum traces the journey of blacks towards racial equality, often distressingly plagued by setbacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So to move on to the First White House of the Confederacy, just a 20-minute walk away, is bewildering. It stands just off the capitol grounds, a few blocks from the church at which King preached. Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy, used this as his White House for four months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is, in effect, a monument to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;white victimhood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. There is scarcely a mention of slavery to be found among its displays. One room features the Davis family Bible, which was found by a Northern soldier during the “war between the states” (a euphemism for the civil war), and later returned to the family. A docent tells visitors about the conditions of Davis’s imprisonment after the war, describing it as tantamount to “torture”. Two women listening to him coo in sympathy. The elegant armchair sent to him while in captivity sits on display.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;An approving full-length obituary from a Mississippi newspaper sits on the wall, subtitled “An American Patriot”. It declares that “No man laboured harder to preserve the union than did Davis. Only when it became obvious that the terrible schism was inevitable did he consent reluctantly to accept the presidency of the confederacy.” The idea of the Lost Cause—that the war was over northern aggression, states’ rights or chivalric duty, not the preservation of slavery—is widely believed. It is given official succour by places such as the Confederate Memorial Monument, on the grounds of the state capitol. Beneath the statue of a Confederate soldier an inscription declares: “The knightliest of the knightly race/who since the lamps of old/have kept the lamp of chivalry/alight in the hearts of gold”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The memorial had been adorned with four Confederate flags until the massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Thereafter several states, including Alabama, took down the flags from official sites because of their association with white supremacism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, it is surreal for a city to commemorate both the achievements of the civil-rights movement—documenting the white-supremacist rhetoric and violence that attempted to arrest it—while also preserving Confederate memorials that whitewash the underlying cause of the conflict. Some will plead that these Confederate monuments should stand as they are for the sake of historical preservation. But they do not honestly preserve history. They distort it by omitting any mention of slavery and transmogrifying those who fought to preserve it into men of Arthurian virtue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other acts seem hard to justify, too. Alabama, along with Mississippi, still jointly celebrates Martin Luther King Jr Day, a federal holiday, at the same time as Robert E Lee Day, a state holiday that commemorates the birthday of the commander of the Confederate army. To this day, there remains a Jefferson Davis high school in Montgomery, even though &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.publicschoolreview.com/jefferson-davis-high-school-profile&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;94% of its pupils are black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am not the first to notice this jarring juxtaposition. But having just witnessed at first hand the long and mournful legacy of slavery—in which poverty, bad schooling and dire job prospects are transmitted from one generation to the next—the contrast struck me all the harder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fifty-five years after the passage of landmark civil-rights and anti-poverty legislation, it has become easy and even popular to describe the poverty of black Americans as a consequence of their own bad decisions. Their poverty is a complicated phenomenon—too complicated to reduce to determinism of the historical kind (which blames it entirely on slavery) or of the present-day variety (which blames it on sloth). Even so, for the state to sponsor uncritical and ahistorical Confederate memorials is to deny entirely the historical roots of black deprivation—thereby making it conveniently easy to ignore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2019 01:40:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why we should embrace big business]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/05/24/why-we-should-embrace-big-business]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_OPP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-24T17:59:12Z&quot;&gt;May 24th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF THERE is one truth that millennials hold to be self-evident, it is that big business is bad. Soulless corporations pollute the planet, overpay their bosses and gouge consumers. Big tech turns us into screen addicts. Big Pharma makes life-saving drugs unaffordable. Big banks sell us dodgy mortgages. One cannot help wondering, listening to the chatter on social media, whether corporations ever do anything right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, they do, says Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University in Virginia. In his latest book “Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero,” he argues that many of the gripes about business are ill-informed. And where there are real concerns, such as fraud or excessive concentrations of power, he believes that wise regulation can minimise the harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Cowen has earned a reputation as a shrewd and iconoclastic thinker. In his blog Marginal Revolution he relishes debunking junk economics with data. &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future initiative is publishing an excerpt from “Big Business” that presents the arc of his argument. We probe it further in a short interview that follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*       *      *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190525_opp504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190525_opp504.jpg 200w,

Among Democrats, for instance, the word “socialism” now polls better than does “capitalism.” But Republicans, while they pay greater lip service to some business ideals, are not in practice much better. Many of them have quite readily followed President Donald Trump into his attacks on free trade, immigration, outsourcing, and the American media (which is labeled “the enemy of the people”)—all fundamentally anti-business stances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business, quite simply, has become underrated, and thus I am writing a contrarian book that ought not to be contrarian at all. All of the criticisms one might mount against the corporate form—some of which are valid—pale in contrast to two straightforward and indeed essential virtues. First, business makes most of the stuff we enjoy and consume. Second, business is what gives most of us jobs. The two words that follow most immediately from the world of business are “prosperity” and “opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without business we would not have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ships, trains, and cars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Electricity, lighting, and heating equipment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Most of our food supply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Most of our lifesaving pharmaceuticals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Clothes for our children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Our telephones and smartphones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The books we love to read&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The ability to access, more or less immediately, so much of the world’s online information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget your paycheck. “Meeting payroll,” to invoke a now old-fashioned phrase, is nothing less than a heroic act. Someone or some group put in the hard work and thought up the innovations required to create a company from scratch—I know it’s easy enough to take this for granted if you aren’t the one who did it. On top of the paycheck, jobs are among our biggest sources of pride and a significant way to meet friends and establish social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can all admit that we are a nation sorely in need of virtue, specifically in our political realm. The growing polarization of today’s politics has made our government at best hopelessly sclerotic and at worst prone to unpredictable lurches. This polarization has also spurred out-of-control political correctness and censorship, rampant racism and injustice, new waves of violent marches and shootings, and an array of indictments and corruption charges. Many features of contemporary America are wonderful, including the high level of trust in the corporate sector, but the weirdness in our government has been rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the world of American business has never been more productive, more tolerant, and more cooperative. It is not just a source of GDP and prosperity; it is a ray of normalcy and predictability in its steady focus on producing what can be profitably sold to customers. Successful businesses grow dynamically, but they also try to create oases of stability and tolerance in which they can perfect their production methods. These oases help to attract and retain talent and make it possible for businesses to offer consumers a steady stream of “comfort products.” Business helps carve out spaces for love, friendship, creativity, and human caring by producing the resources that make our lives not just tolerable but comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American big business in particular has led the way toward making America more socially inclusive. McDonald’s, General Electric, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, and many of the major tech companies, among others, were defining health and other legal benefits for same-sex partners before the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft, Deutsche Bank, PayPal, and Marriott, among others, spoke out or protested the North Carolina law that sought to specify which restrooms transgender people had to use; the outcry led to the eventual repeal of that law. This push for tolerance shouldn’t come as any surprise. Big business has lots of customers and relies on the value of brand names. It doesn’t want any group of those customers to feel put out or discriminated against or to have cause for complaint, not least because we live in an age of social media. Profit maximization alone—not to mention the consciences of some CEOs—puts big business these days on the side of inclusion and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger firms, in particular, which you can think of as wildly successful businesses and thus embodiments of the logic of business, tend to be more tolerant of employee personal tastes than smaller firms. A local baker might be reluctant to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, but Sara Lee, which tries to build very broadly based national markets for its products, is happy to sell to all. The bigger companies need to protect their broader reputations and recruit large numbers of talented workers, including those from minority groups. They can’t survive and grow just by cultivating a few narrow networks of local white men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a complaint about America today, and it is simple: we don’t love business enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m here to speak up for business, to persuade you that it deserves more of your love and less hate. Perhaps, like you, I am not entirely comfortable with ceding so much of the daily human realm to apparently selfish, profit-maximizing, and even sometimes corrupt entities, but on closer examination this is a better bargain than it might seem at first. Indeed, at its best, business gives our lives more scope for the heroic and the noble, as we can use the outputs of business to satisfy our own creative desires and to better our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll argue that a lot of the most common criticisms of American business don’t stand up to scrutiny. For instance, it’s often claimed that American business is too focused on quarterly earnings statements, at the expense of a longer-run perspective. But in fact there is plenty of evidence that companies can think long-term when appropriate. Sometimes short-run problems are easier or more important to solve, or they are the bridge to longer-run success, and the evidence at hand indicates that American business does a pretty good job of looking to the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the question of American CEO pay, which Edward Luce, a Financial Times columnist (and a friend of mine), described on Twitter as “unconscionable.” American CEOs are paid much more than they used to be, but these pay hikes have pretty much moved in tandem with the size and valuations of the firms they manage. Contrary to common claims, it is hard to establish that CEOs as a whole are ripping off their shareholders with manipulated pay packages, as a look at the numbers will show that high compensation is the price of attracting top talent. Running a large corporation involves taking on more roles than ever before, including media, government, and public relations, formulating a vision, understanding consumers and communicating to them, building cross-cultural global strategies, working with governments, and keeping the company out of trouble, in addition to having a lot of sector-specific expertise. That limits the number of eligible candidates who might succeed at the job and thus it boosts their pay, according to basic principles of supply and demand. Today’s CEOs are literally superachievers, and it should come as no surprise that they are compensated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most frequently cited whipping boys is the financial sector, which is portrayed as too large and out of control. The reality is that the financial sector has held to a fairly constant 2 percent share of American wealth, though of course that wealth has grown and so has finance with it. The ability of American finance to mobilize savings into riskier forms of equity and venture capital has brought Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in value each year, and those gains significantly outweigh the costs typically attributed to the financial sector. Nor is the financial sector draining the American economy of all its talent for other endeavors, as evidenced by the rise of American manufacturing output to ever higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all, business is criticized for being fraudulent and ripping us off. While there is plenty of fraud in business, the commercial sector isn’t any more fraudulent than individuals in other capacities, and it may even be somewhat less fraudulent. Business can make us better people—for example, by teaching us how to cooperate better—and the best evidence indicates that, on net, businesses do not make us worse compared with our participation in other institutions. A lot of us were somewhat dishonest to begin with, and if you have doubts, just look at the individual lies and misrepresentations in online dating profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many of the problems with business are in fact problems with us, and they reflect the underlying and fairly universal imperfections of human nature. Yet we respond to this truth somewhat irrationally. While we suspect business of wrongdoing, at the same time we expect corporations to give us jobs and take care of us, to give us a network of friends, to solve our social problems, and to give us risk-free consumption experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly now in the age of social media, which allows direct connections with consumers and offers them the chance to provide direct feedback when things go wrong, the most successful businesses have a kind of messianic view of their role in society—venerating the delivery of goods and services to the consumer, or perhaps promoting a particular vision of how society ought to be. Workers wish to believe their toil is saving the environment, fighting poverty, and strengthening America as a nation. A business that instills in its workers and managers a sincere belief in such goals has a better chance of building a durable competitive advantage than a business that does not. It will attract more consumer loyalty and better and more cooperative partners at the business-to-business level. Think of it this way: Who wants to marry someone who is always selfishly seeking to optimize happiness from the marriage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand showed a deep insight into the character of successful business when she emphasized that it can be a vehicle for the achievement of heroic goals. The character of Hank Rearden in Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged stressed the dignity, honor, and reason involved in good productive work, and he came to see it as the very foundation of America’s greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often those business leaders who are religious or have strong ideologies of another kind who grasp most clearly the relevance of a business having a mission above and beyond profit. They understand that the business and religious or ideological sides of their lives are by no means totally separate. They understand they can do best by their shareholders—and the broader society—by tying together the business, religious, ethical, and ideological perspectives in one bundle. […]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, business at its best is a fundamentally ethical enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;__________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excerpted from “Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero” by Tyler Cowen.

For most goods and services, Americans have far more choice, choice of supplier and diversity of product than ever before. Consumers know this intuitively and it has turned out that recent claims about increased concentration in the American economy are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w25066.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largely wrong&lt;/a&gt; on a factual basis. In most sectors there is more actual competition, and the dominant players we do have, such as Amazon and Walmart, typically are lowering rather than raising prices when they enter markets. For the tech sector, there are dominant product suppliers such as Google and Facebook, but they are hardly following the old monopolist playbook of higher prices and restricted output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is too much concentration in the hospital sector, and in K-12 education: it’s a government semi-monopoly, and it’s hard to compete with the free government product unless you are selling to wealthy families. We also have some outrageously high prices for real estate and higher education, but those are due to supply constraints and excess regulation, rather than private monopoly. In all of these cases I would consider legal remedies to give consumers a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you fear most about the effects of the anti-business sentiment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; For a start, I fear we will split up our big tech companies, or at the very least severely distract senior management with antitrust suits. An alternative route we might go down is to enact severe privacy legislation which raises costs to new market entrants, and cements in the power of the incumbents. Either of those two paths would be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most generally, I fear that the status of going into business will fall, as it already has in much of Europe. It would hurt America greatly to lose its genius and distinct preference for business activity. Culture really does matter, and America stands at risk of losing its pro-business, pro-entrepreneurship leanings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; What do businesses need to do to improve their image, other than PR?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; Business has to realise it always will be held to a higher standard, perhaps unjustly so, but still that is a reality. That means business ought to opt for less fraud, less lobbying for crony capitalism, more social conscience when it comes to pollution and climate change, and also bolder, less bureaucratic decision-making procedures. We are pretty far from that world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stress in the book, a lot of business is pretty fraudulent. The thing is, human beings are fraudulent too; maybe more so outside of a business context. Ask a simple question: who lies more, the company Match.com, or the online daters filling out their profiles? The answer is both obvious and sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; What can individuals and groups do to hold businesses to account?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; Search for the best price; it benefits the whole market. Speak up when you are unhappy, noting that the internet makes the monitoring of business quality easier than ever before. When it comes to health care, educate yourself. So much of the waste in the American economy is in that sector. And, if you really see persistent business failures in a particular area, consider starting a business yourself to fix them. Or recommend the business idea to someone else. All of the best businesses today were at some point in the past unrealised dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt; If we can&amp;#x27;t look to the political sphere for leadership to address global challenges, are we right to turn to business for that leadership? Ought they to rise to that mission, even if it strays from their central remit of making and selling their widgets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Cowen:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the biggest global challenges will require contributions from both government and business. Take climate change. Yes, governments need to regulate more and tax carbon emissions. But we also need businesses to step up and innovate. We’re seeing a systematic tendency to villainise the role of business in carbon emissions and pollution. Yes, business has had a major role in this, but so have consumers, so have voters, so have all of us. The reality is that we will need the help of business to solve the problem, and we should not make this a question of us versus them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 03:41:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
