For more than a century many investors have trusted financial experts to pick the best shares for them, in return for a hefty fee. But even the experts can get it badly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has been the case this week with Woodford Investment Management, which has suffered two devastating blows. The first occurred when the firm suspended trading in its flagship Equity Income fund, locking in investors’ money. The second came when St James’s Place, a wealth management group, announced that it was replacing Woodford as the manager of some £3.5bn worth of assets. That move alone reduced the amount of money managed by Woodford by around 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Woodford crisis illustrates a much broader trend. Investors have steadily been realising that the experts can struggle to outperform the market. Instead they have been pouring money into funds that simply seek to mimic the market, but charge low fees. Assets in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rose from $716bn in 2008 to almost $4.7trn at the end of last year, according to Statista, an information group. The two biggest fund management groups in the world, BlackRock and Vanguard, specialise in index-tracking or passive funds. Active funds (those that try to beat the market) have struggled to perform over periods from one to 10 years. The right-hand chart shows that only a tiny proportion of funds investing in UK equities (like the Woodford fund) have beaten the market over periods from one to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the long period when he was a fund manager at Invesco Perpetual, Neil Woodford seemed to be an exception to this rule. He picked unfashionable stocks in areas like tobacco and avoided the dotcom boom. His success prompted many clients to follow him when he set up his own firm in 2014. Woodford Investment Management was managing more than £10bn at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190608_woc216.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190608_woc216.png 200w,

The left-hand chart shows the percentage of US managers in the top quartile (best performing 25%) of 2014 that repeated the feat in succeeding years. If the results were just random, then 25% of managers should repeat the feat in the first year, 12.5% in the second, 6.25% in the third and so on. As you can see, the figures become much worse than random as time goes on. Picking managers on the basis of past performance is a mug’s game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is that so? The most obvious reason is that outperformance over a short period is down to luck more than skill and that, over time, managers revert to the mean. Since fund managers own most of the market, their performance is, on average, likely to replicate the market, before costs. Those costs can be significant (often, more than a percentage point a year) so that the average manager is doomed to underperform, after those costs are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star managers will, by definition, have portfolios that do not look like the overall market. Often they will have made a limited number of bets on a small number of companies. As their reputation grows, money will flood in from new investors. For a while, they might try to invest in the same shares as before. But if they are not careful, they will end up owning 20-30% of such companies. So the temptation will be to spread the portfolio over a broader range of groups. The danger is that their 50th favourite stock might not be as good a bet as their top ten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting pattern can be strong performance in the early years, but a more mediocre result later on. The long-term return numbers can still look good. But most clients will have invested their money after the stellar years; the return earned by the average client will not be that great. A classic example of this phenomenon was Fidelity Magellan. When Peter Lynch took over the fund in 1977, it had just $22m in assets. He achieved a return of 29% a year on average until 1990, by which stage the fund had $14bn under management. Assets continued to pour in under his immediate successors and the fund reached more than $100bn, making it by far the biggest mutual fund in 2000. But the fund lagged the market for years afterwards; the latecomers (who invested the bulk of the money) lost out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Woodford tried to escape the rut by investing in smaller stocks, some of which were unquoted and some of which were listed on the tiny Guernsey exchange. This meant that his fund did not resemble the conventional market, and thus had the chance to outperform. But it created three problems. The first was that Mr Woodford was running an equity income fund, which meant that he needed to find companies that paid regular dividends; small, unquoted companies tend not to do this. The second problem was some of Mr Woodford’s bets went badly wrong: the fund has returned 11% since its launch, compared with the UK market’s 34%. The third problem was the greatest. Woodford Equity Income is an “open-ended” fund. When investors buy into the fund, its assets rise, and the manager must buy more shares; when they sell, the assets fall, and the manager must sell. There was thus a mismatch between Mr Woodford’s clients, who could demand instant liquidity, and his assets, a proportion of which was difficult to sell. Poor performance has been causing money to head out of the fund, with £560m flowing out in May, according to Morningstar, an investment research firm. When one big client, Kent County Council, demanded its money back, trading was suspended to give Woodford time to realise the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this was a big shock for Mr Woodford’s prominent backers, including Hargreaves Lansdown, a leading financial adviser. The Woodford fund was on its “Wealth 50” list of favourite funds. And Hargreaves also runs its own funds, one of which, the Multi-Manager Income &amp;amp; Growth Trust, had £405m (13.7% of its assets) in the Woodford fund. So it is not just the experts who can get it wrong; so can the experts who pick the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, those arguing that UK investors should stick to passive tracking funds have faced the comeback “What about Neil Woodford?” They won’t get that comeback any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 02:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“Good Omens”: too twee or not too twee?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/06/06/good-omens-too-twee-or-not-too-twee]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190608_BKP510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-06T15:41:19Z&quot;&gt;Jun 6th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE ARE not a lot of things at which the English can still claim to be world champions, but being twee is one of them. Even the Scandinavians, with their bicycles and midsummer celebrations and hygge, cannot match the everyday tweeness of the English, who go on holibobs (holidays) and say “soz” (sorry) because they can’t make it “tomoz” (tomorrow). The Scandinavians have dark winters and darker thrillers to balance out their twee. England has rather grim soap operas, and Brexit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twee, for those unfamiliar with the term, is a word that means cute, or precious, but in an excessive, affected kind of way. Lovely little villages with little model versions of themselves and cosy pubs and shops that sell only brollies (umbrellas) or jumpers (sweaters) or puds (desserts) are twee. And this is a particularly English affliction. The Welsh are not twee. Nor are the Scots, or, heaven forfend, the Irish (saying “heaven forfend” is definitely twee). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to “Good Omens”, a book published in 1990. The authors, both legends in their own right, are Neil Gaiman, latterly of ��Sandman” and “American Gods” fame, and the late Terry Pratchett, of the “Discworld” series. Being both English writers with a penchant for dressing in black and writing humorous sci-fi/fantasy novels, the pair’s collaboration inevitably produced a book that used twee as its narrative engine. Nearly three decades later, Amazon Prime has brought it to the screen in six very twee episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good Omens” revolves around an angel, Aziraphale (Michael Sheen, combining twee with camp), a demon, Crowley (David Tennant channelling Bill Nighy in “Love Actually”), and the end of the world. Aziraphale and Crowley have been on earth since Genesis. They have come to quite the like the place—it’s set in Oxfordshire, perhaps the twee-est county in England—and grown reasonably fond of each other too. So with the end of the world approaching, and bosses on both sides quite keen to have a good, old-fashioned showdown, the pair sets out to try to avert the apocalypse. Not for the good of humanity: it’s more that heaven is pretty dull and hell rather unpleasant. They are neither helped nor hindered by “The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch”, which is the name of a book of predictions in “Good Omens” and also the subtitle of “Good Omens”, the book, itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it all work, and rise above the twee? Yes and no. The whole point of the book, and indeed the series, is to revel in the twee-ness. The show tones it down somewhat, thankfully, but not very much. It is, therefore, a simple decision for any viewer: regardless of the actual plot, acting, set design, or any other aspect of the content of “Good Omens”, those who like twee will like the show. Those who don’t will find it tedious and pointless. And for everyone else it will fall somewhere on the spectrum between mildly entertaining and mildly irritating. Because the thing about twee is that, like English weather, its defining characteristic is its very mildness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Good Omens” is available on Amazon now and will be broadcast on the BBC later this year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:40:13 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Regulating Big Tech makes them stronger, so they need competition instead]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/06/06/regulating-big-tech-makes-them-stronger-so-they-need-competition-instead]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190608_OPP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-06T14:42:31Z&quot;&gt;Jun 6th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT IS hard to find anyone cheering for a world dominated by a few giants. It is even harder to find anyone who thinks that Big Tech stands any chance of being toppled. Both the right and the left clamour for a break-up of the biggest web platforms, notably in America—from the trustbusting manifesto pledge by Elizabeth Warren, a democratic senator, to the followers of Alex Jones, a right-wing commentator, who was recently banned from several social-media sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monopoly break-ups are the disused weapons of antitrust. Like stone pyramids, they seem a relic of history, a lost art from a fallen civilisation. Yet they are exceptionally hard to do politically. So if break-ups belong to the past, how can society tame Big Tech? The question has fresh salience as America’s Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission divvy up which agency will handle possible antitrust investigations of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a political faith in break-ups, modern trustbusters are operating on the assumption that Big Tech will dominate in perpetuity—and placing upon the incumbents the state-like duties to police bad user activities, from fomenting terrorist violence to infringing copyright. Yet this raises a new problem: complying with these rules would be so expensive that only a handful of (mostly American) companies could afford it. This snuffs out any hope of a big incumbent being displaced by a nascent competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a creator who derives the bulk of his living from giant media companies, it has been hard for me to watch those companies—and other creators who should really know better—act as cheerleaders for a situation in which the Big Tech firms are being handed a prize beyond measure: control over what is, in effect, a planetary, species-wide electronic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190608_opp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/blogs/open-future/20190608_opp501.jpg 200w,

This will have grave consequences for privacy, free expression and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with the European Union&amp;#x27;s privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force a year ago. This created stringent requirements for data-handling, breach notification and user consent. It also imposes a duty on firms to track how the data they collect are used, including by third parties with whom they are shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is much to like about these rules for privacy, the cost of implementing it has meant consolidation in Europe’s ad-tech market. The American giants have emerged as the clear winners. What&amp;#x27;s more, there is a good chance they will be able to retain that advantage, thanks to a massive loophole in the EU rules that allows for virtually unfettered exploitation of data if it is “pseudonymised” (even though many computer scientists doubt that true pseudonymisation is possible, and the concept is left undefined in the GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Europe’s privacy rules went into force, America’s Congress passed legislation called SESTA/FOSTA. Don’t worry about the actual name, the “ST” in both acronyms stands for “sex trafficking”, and the law makes online firms liable if users are engaged in sex-trafficking crimes. Because firms are unable to distinguish between the consensual sex-trade and the deplorable activities the law was designed to stop, virtually every online forum where Americans discussed sex-work has gone dark. Included were forums where sex-workers exchanged warnings about violent customers and screen potential clients. The result is a renaissance in dangerous street prostitution, with much higher levels of violence and victimisation, and a new golden-age for pimps, whose “protection services” are once again in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next came the EU Copyright Directive, passed last March. It imposed even more sweeping duties on the big web platforms, such as ascertaining the copyright status of everything that users post online, and blocking potentially infringing material. Though its supporters insisted that the legislation was not a mandate to buy the sort of filters that YouTube uses (already notorious for over-blocking innocent material) now that the directive has been approved, it is now widely acknowledged that filters are inevitable. YouTube&amp;#x27;s modest Content ID system cost $100m to build and maintain, with ongoing operating costs—and it is still insufficient to satisfy the directive&amp;#x27;s requirements. The directive exempts smaller services, but only for the first few years of operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the Christchurch white-supremicist terrorist attacks, and calls for the platforms to take action to curb extremism and violence. The Australian government—long a breeding ground for questionable internet regulation—hastily passed a rule requiring platforms to remove “terrorist” content within an hour of notification. The EU has advanced its own plan, called the Terror Regulation, with the same provision. Britain is considering a comparable law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how this plays out, consider the situation last April with France’s cybercrime watchdog. It demanded the removal of more than 15m documents from the servers at the Internet Archive in California. This included the Gutenberg Project&amp;#x27;s public-domain books and the Internet Archive&amp;#x27;s legendary collection of Grateful Dead recordings. The Archive was given 24 hours to comply, which would be reduced to just a single hour if the EU’s Terror Regulation is approved (in a matter of weeks or months depending on the EU&amp;#x27;s legislative calendar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating state-like duties for the big tech platforms imposes short-term pain on their shareholders in exchange for long-term gain. Shaving a few hundred million dollars off a company&amp;#x27;s quarterly earnings to pay for compliance is a bargain in exchange for a world in which they need not fear a rival growing large enough to compete with them. Google can stop looking over its shoulder for the next company that will do to it what it did to Yahoo, and Facebook can stop watching for someone ready to cast it in the role of MySpace, in the next social media upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These duties can only be performed by the biggest companies, which all-but forecloses on the possibility of breaking up Big Tech. Once it has been knighted to serve as an arm of the state, Big Tech cannot be cut down to size if it is to perform those duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months there has been a radical shift in the balance of power on the internet. In the name of taming the platforms, regulators have inadvertently issued them a “Perpetual Internet Domination Licence”, albeit one that requires that they take advice from an aristocracy of elite regulators. With only the biggest tech companies able to perform the regulatory roles they have been assigned because of complexity and cost, they officially become too big to fail, and can only be nudged a little in one direction or another by regulators drawn from their own ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has been the case so often in the internet&amp;#x27;s brief life, humanity has entered uncharted territory. People (sort of) know how to break up a railway or an oil company and America once barely managed to break up a phone company. No one is sure how to break up a tech monopolist. Depending on how this moment plays out, that option may be lost altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But competition is too important to give up on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One exciting possibility is to create an absolute legal defence for companies that make &amp;quot;interoperable&amp;quot; products that plug into the dominant companies&amp;#x27; offerings, from third-party printer ink to unauthorised Facebook readers that slurp up all the messages waiting for you there and filter them to your specifications, not Mark Zuckerberg&amp;#x27;s. This interoperability defence would have to shield digital toolsmiths from all manner of claims: tortious interference, bypassing copyright locks, patent infringement and, of course, violating terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoperability is a competitive lever that is crying to be used, hard. After all, the problem with YouTube isn&amp;#x27;t that it makes a lot of interesting videos available—it is that it uses search and suggestion filters that lead viewers into hateful, extreme bubbles. The problem with Facebook isn&amp;#x27;t that they have made a place where all your friends can be found—it is that it tries to &amp;quot;maximise engagement&amp;quot; by poisoning your interactions with inflammatory or hoax material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a monopolised market, sellers get to bargain by fiat. But interoperability—from ad-blocking to switching app stores—is a means by which customers can assay real counteroffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;______________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cory Doctorow is the author of numerous books including “Radicalized” and “Walkaway,” and the co-founder of the UK Open Rights Group.

Should offenders be sent to prison &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; punishment, or &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; punishment? Is it enough to merely deprive them of their liberty, or will their debt only truly be paid if the time they spend behind bars is made as uncomfortable and demeaning as the penal codes allow?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the question at the heart of Christopher Impey’s enthralling book, which is both a social history of HMP Brixton—published in the year of the prison’s 200th anniversary—and of the criminal justice system within which it has played a prominent and often controversial role. It is a question he asks in all urgency, yet with a sensitivity that belies his personal connection to the place (he worked there for nine years, in his former role as managing editor of National Prison Radio, which has been broadcasting from HMP Brixton since 2007). In short, focused chapters, Mr Impey charts the prison’s many rises and falls: from its beginnings as a house of correction built to accommodate a new vagrant class, which had flocked to the fast-expanding city from a rural heartland impoverished by landgrabs and industrialisation; through the eras of Victorian puritanism and modern social reform, during which HMP Brixton was variously regarded as a pit of squalor and despair and a centre for enlightened rehabilitative ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recurring waves of good and ill fortune have beset it, as successive governors have imposed diverse agendas and the nation’s moral fashions have swung between desires for vengeance and forgiveness. Every advance—from the installation, as recently as 1992, of plumbed toilets in every cell, to the opening in 2014 of The Clink, a highly-rated restaurant located onsite, where the menu is prepared and served by prisoners—is mitigated by reminders of historical abuses. There are harrowing descriptions of the infamous treadmill (a 19th-century giant hamster-wheel contraption to which inmates, including nursing mothers, were chained for up to ten hours a day) and of the force-feeding of Irish Republican prisoners on hunger strike in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arc of history may bend towards justice, but it takes many detours along the way. It is in describing these detours that the book does its best work. With a novelist’s eye for the illuminating detail, Mr Impey provides a series of vivid insights into the lives of those men and women who at one time or another have called HMP Brixton home (originally a mixed prison, Brixton housed only female convicts between 1852 and 1869, and became male-only at the turn of the 20th century). He introduces readers to women prisoners “scraping the walls of their cells and using the powder of the whitewash to whiten their complexion”. He takes them into the prison nursery, home to “youngsters—none aged over four...all dressed in the same spotted blue frocks—their own kind of convict uniform”. During wartime air raids, male prisoners “stood at their cell windows and cheered the British fighter aircraft”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entertaining digressions abound. A chapter devoted to the successful escape attempts which have occurred over the years reads like a breathless thriller with farcical, Coenesque overtones. A summary of the prison’s celebrity guests includes encounters with Bertrand Russell (who served six months in 1918 for “pacifist activities”), Mick Jagger (a single night on remand for drug possession) and Oswald Mosley (who complained, during his detention for being a Nazi sympathiser, that he found it difficult to read over the din caused by his fellow prisoners playing table tennis).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this anecdotal style, Mr Impey succeeds in crafting an intensely human story from the biography of a building. He finds in its stinking, overcrowded corridors numerous cases of institutionalised cruelty and individual suffering; but he also unearths many examples of striking ingenuity and bonhomie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lasting effect is not unlike peering at a painting such as Bruegel the Elder’s “Children’s Games”—a teeming, vulgar and transcendent record of medieval life. What appears from a distance to be a collection of incidental figures is revealed, on closer study, to be both an indictment and a celebration of humanity in all its individual abundance and fallibility. The peasant boy riding his hobby horse and the girl poking her stick in a pile of manure are no mere cyphers, they are everyman. By exposing the inner lives behind the prison bars, Mr Impey makes a compelling argument for compassion and rehabilitation. Society has come far since Brixton’s dark infancy; it still has far to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEPHEN KELMAN*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Our policy is to identify the reviewer of any book by or about someone closely connected with &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;.

But many people worry about algorithms absorbing human prejudices. Robert Epstein, an academic, has compiled data that show Google suggesting more positive terms when users type “Hillary Clinton” than when they look up Mr Trump. &lt;small&gt;PJ&lt;/small&gt; Media, a conservative blog, claims that liberal sites get 96% of results for “Trump” on Google’s news page, a compilation of links to recent articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google says that the 10,000 human evaluators who rate sources for its search engine assess “expertise” and “trustworthiness” but not ideology. Web-traffic figures support this defence. Sites with high scores from fact-checking groups, whose judgments probably resemble Google’s, draw larger shares of their visitors from search engines than sites with low scores do. Factually inaccurate sources also tend to have strong left- or right-wing slants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, a subtle bias might not show up in such broad statistics. To test for favouritism, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; ran an experiment, comparing a news site’s share of search results with a statistical prediction based on its output, reach and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first wrote a program to obtain Google results for any keyword. Using a browser with no history, in a politically centrist part of Kansas, we searched for 31 terms for each day in 2018, yielding 175,000 links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we built a model to predict each site’s share of the links Google produces for each keyword, based on the premise that search results should reflect accuracy and audience size, as Google claims. We started with each outlet’s popularity on social media and, using data from Meltwater, a media-tracking firm, how often they covered each topic. We also used accuracy ratings from fact-checking websites, tallies of Pulitzer prizes and results from a poll by YouGov about Americans’ trust in 37 sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://infographics.economist.com/2019/20190608_GDC141_newsbias/index.html&quot;  frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Google favoured liberals, left-wing sites would appear more often than our model predicted, and right-wing ones less. We saw no such trend. Overall, centre-left sites like the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; got the most links—but only about as many as our model suggested. Fox News beat its modest expectations. Because most far-right outlets had bad trust scores, they got few search results. But so did Daily Kos, a far-left site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-infographic-&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study does not prove Google is impartial. In theory, Google could serve un-biased links only to users without a browsing history. If fact-checkers and Pulitzer voters are partisan, our model will be too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some keywords did suggest bias—in both directions. Just as &lt;small&gt;PJ&lt;/small&gt; Media charged, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; was over-represented on searches for “Trump”. However, searches for “crime” leaned right: Fox News got far more links than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies that Google’s main form of favouritism is to boost viral articles. The most incendiary stories about Mr Trump come from leftist sources. Gory crime coverage is more prevalent on right-leaning sites. Readers will keep clicking on both. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;◼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-interactive-&gt;Sources: Google; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.adfontesmedia.com/&quot;&gt;Adfontesmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://mediabiasfactcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Mediabiasfactcheck.com&lt;/a&gt;; YouGov; Meltwater; SimilarWeb; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.pulitzer.org/&quot;&gt;Pulitzer.org&lt;/a&gt;; Facebook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-infographic-js=&quot;/2019/gd-google-news-bias/js/bundle.js&quot; data-infographic-css=&quot;/2019/gd-google-news-bias/css/style.css&quot;&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://infographics.economist.com/2019/gd-google-news-bias/css/style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure data-infographic-css=&quot;/2018/site-fixes/style.css&quot;&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://infographics.economist.com/2018/site-fixes/style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Graphic detail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;Seek and you shall find&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 22:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Donald Trump’s visit to Britain goes well—at least for him]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/06/06/donald-trumps-visit-to-britain-goes-well-at-least-for-him]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_brp503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-06T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 6th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;ONALD TRUMP&lt;/small&gt; saw only people cheering, not protests, reports of which the president branded “fake news”. They did not seem so fake on Whitehall. Placards said “Dump Trump”, “Trump: Climate Disaster” and “Keep Trump away from our &lt;small&gt;NHS&lt;/small&gt;”. One optimistic poster proposed “Stop Brexit, stop Trump”. Most bizarre was a banner saying “Man Utd fans against apartheid”. The mood was cheerful, even carnival-like—at least until it rained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ever, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn came out to back the protests. But his disdain was diluted after Mr Trump revealed that he had rejected a meeting request from Mr Corbyn, whom he dubbed a “negative force”. He said the same of Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, calling him a “stone-cold loser”. This contrasted with his enthusiasm for Brexiteers, singling out Boris Johnson as a great potential successor to Theresa May as prime minister. He also met Nigel Farage, whose new Brexit Party is eating into Tory support, and suggested that he should be one of the Brexit negotiators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president clearly valued hobnobbing with royalty and feasting in Buckingham Palace with the queen (whom he called a “fantastic woman”) more than bilateral discussions with Mrs May. But although he said he would have negotiated Brexit differently, by suing the European Union, he also praised Mrs May’s deal. And he glossed over differences on Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant mistrusted by America but cautiously accepted in Britain, by saying that the two countries would soon reach an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade was trickier. Mr Trump promised a “phenomenal” post-Brexit deal that would double or even triple bilateral trade. But he also echoed his ambassador by saying that everything should be on the table. That includes not just farm products but access to the &lt;small&gt;NHS&lt;/small&gt;. When most Tory leadership candidates instantly said the health service was not for sale, Mr Trump backtracked. But his own trade negotiating documents make clear that America will look for more &lt;small&gt;NHS&lt;/small&gt; contracts and higher drug prices. What’s more, Congress has said it will not ratify any trade deal if Brexit is seen to threaten peace in Northern Ireland. A bilateral deal looks both hard and far off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British managed to get in a few subtle digs of their own, with the queen and Mrs May going out of their way to praise the role of international institutions, which Mr Trump has criticised or in some cases abandoned. The prime minister openly admitted to differences on climate change and Iran, and she used this week’s &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Day commemoration to remind the president of the value of &lt;small&gt;NATO&lt;/small&gt; in upholding the global order. Mr Trump’s response was to repeat his demand that &lt;small&gt;NATO&lt;/small&gt; allies spend more on defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides praising Mr Johnson, with whom he spoke by phone, Mr Trump sought meetings with Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who he said would make a good prime minister, and with Michael Gove, the environment secretary, whom he claimed not to know. The White House has clearly decided these are the three strongest candidates to succeed Mrs May. It is not obvious that Mr Trump’s support will prove helpful, any more than did Barack Obama’s backing for the Remain campaign in 2016. Yet it could weigh with some Tory party members. Certainly Mr Hunt and Mr Gove seemed pleased. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;◼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Britain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;When the Donald calls&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 22:39:56 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advertising may make people miserable, but it still has its uses]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/06/06/advertising-may-make-people-miserable-but-it-still-has-its-uses]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_fnd000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-06T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 6th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;VERY YEAR&lt;/small&gt;, as Americans polish off their Thanksgiving feasts, a particular genre of advertisement begins to air. The details vary, but the plot does not: one family member surprises another with the Christmas gift of a luxury car, often adorned with a cartoonishly large bow. The recipient never betrays a hint of the dismay one might expect of someone whose partner has spent tens of thousands of dollars without consultation. Such a car can easily cost more than the median annual income of an American household, and most people who see these ads will not be able to afford one. But the envy such spots induce serves an economic purpose, even as it leaves the majority feeling worse about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads and other forms of marketing ostensibly serve a straightforward economic role. Firms selling goods and services need to tell consumers about the availability and desirability of their wares, and spend on advertising to do so. By informing consumers about the relative merits of various products, ads improve the quality of purchasing decisions and, conceivably, leave both firms and shoppers better off than they would be in an ad-free world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet advertising might fall short of this ideal in many ways. It need not be honest or representative of the full range of available products, for example. Some firms target impressionable children, in ways which could contribute to long-run health risks. London has recently banned junk-food advertising on its transport network, a prohibition campaigners want to extend. And honest or not, successful ads induce a desire to spend, perhaps on things the audience does not need or cannot afford. The information content of ads for fancy vacations, bespoke cars or diamond-studded watches does not much matter for people whose budgets cannot accommodate them. Their main takeaway is that others get to enjoy things that they themselves cannot afford. If the effect of advertising is mostly to encourage people to want things that they cannot have, rather than to direct them towards items that are a good match for their needs and tastes, then it is possible that spending on advertising leaves society worse off overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests this might indeed be the case. A forthcoming paper by Chloé Michel, now at Swiss Re, Michelle Sovinsky of Mannheim University, Eugenio Proto of Bristol University and Andrew Oswald of Warwick University attempts to unpick the effect of advertising on welfare. The researchers used three decades’ worth of survey results from a sample of nearly 1m Europeans, spread across 27 countries, to compare information on self-reported life satisfaction with variation in total advertising spending as a share of &lt;small&gt;GDP&lt;/small&gt;. After taking account of other macroeconomic variables such as unemployment, and individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics, they find a significant and inverse relationship between spending on advertisements and national welfare. They estimate that a doubling of ad spending is associated with a subsequent drop in reported satisfaction of 3%—an effect about a quarter as strong as a spell of unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this result reflects the effect of some other factor which influences both advertising and well-being. And the authors are careful to note that they cannot be certain about the causal mechanism at work. But their findings may illustrate an aspect of the economy that has puzzled some economists for more than a century. In “The Theory of the Leisure Class”, published in 1899, Thorstein Veblen, a Norwegian-American economist, explored the nature of what he termed “conspicuous consumption”. Veblen argued that consumption is not merely about satisfying needs, but is also used to signal status and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The priciest cars may offer more nifty features and a smoother ride than a cheaper marque, but the vast difference in price is not primarily down to such advantages. Rather, the buyer is paying for such cars’ value as a status symbol, which derives from the fact that very few people can afford one. (Following his insight, economists use the name “Veblen good” for items for which demand rises with price, though it is not the high price itself that generates the increased demand but rather the exclusivity that the high price confers.) These luxury items defy normal economic logic. In the mass market, productivity-boosting innovations that allow firms to sell better products at lower prices are a route to success. For producers of conspicuous-consumption items, such cost-cutting does not conquer the market but destroys it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Less good than a feast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that people might buy high-cost items in preference to serviceable alternatives simply to set themselves apart from the less well-off would seem absurd, were the economy not chock-a-block with examples, from designer handbags to silver cutlery to oxygenated energy drinks. Advertising enables the process. For goods to grant high status, there must be consumers who want but cannot have them. Ad campaigns featuring sleek cars bedecked with oversized bows add to the value of luxury brands by informing the masses of how desirable they are—and how inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veblen, though, saw the rich as a largely unproductive class of capital-owning moochers, who profited off the useful labour of working people (hence the “leisure class”). In recent decades, however, the share of Americans working long hours has grown, and has risen fastest among those earning the highest wages—an odd exception to the global norm that working time declines with income. The status envy induced by conspicuous consumption may play a role. In rich countries, most people’s basic needs have long since been met. To keep workers striving—those on higher incomes especially—there must always be more desirable consumer goods and services just out of reach. Perpetual dissatisfaction may well boost economic growth by keeping highly productive workers who might otherwise enjoy more time with their families chained to their desks. But it is a funny sort of prosperity that depends on people never being satisfied with their lot. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;◼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Finance and economics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;Enough is never enough&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:40:48 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Asian countries fear China, but many won’t side with America]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/06/06/americas-vision-for-the-indo-pacific-gets-a-lukewarm-reception]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_asp503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-05T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 5th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HAT DO YOU&lt;/small&gt; buy the Asian defence minister who has everything? How about a “beautiful” photo-book of North Korean ships illegally transferring oil at sea? Patrick Shanahan, America’s acting defence secretary, presented the collection of grainy aerial shots to his Chinese counterpart, General Wei Fenghe, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual gathering of military bigwigs in Singapore from May 31st to June 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an emollient gesture in fractious times. When Banyan asked Mr Shanahan what he planned to say to General Wei in private, the answer was not a tirade about Huawei or the South China Sea. Instead Mr Shanahan said he was “excited” to explore areas of cooperation. North Korean sanctions-busting—which often occurs in Chinese waters—was top of the list. Such collaboration would show that America and China could “compete in a constructive way”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 1st the Pentagon published its plans for that competition in an Indo-Pacific strategy. At its heart was the idea of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” (&lt;small&gt;FOIP&lt;/small&gt;), a nebulous concept conceived by Japan and enthusiastically taken up by the Trump administration. In essence, &lt;small&gt;FOIP&lt;/small&gt; is a rules-based rejoinder to China’s vision of spheres of influence, gunboat diplomacy and murky loans. “No one nation can or should dominate the Indo-Pacific,” said the Pentagon in its report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Shanahan’s notion of responsible competition—in contrast to the no-holds-barred clash of civilisations favoured by some of his head-banging colleagues—is laudable. It is also savvy. Asian states are likelier to sign up to &lt;small&gt;FOIP&lt;/small&gt; if they are persuaded that America is not spoiling for a fight. But on both counts—stabilising the relationship with China, while rallying partners to push back against it—America has an uphill task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the olive branches. General Wei did not so much ignore them as snap them into pieces. “Arise, all those who do not want be enslaved,” he thundered in his speech on June 2nd, quoting China’s national anthem. “Let us build the new Great Wall with our flesh and blood.” He warned that China’s army was “not afraid of sacrifice” and that “we make no promise to renounce the use of force” against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think that such bluster would send Asians rushing to sign up to &lt;small&gt;FOIP&lt;/small&gt; and into America’s arms. In some cases, it has. Narendra Modi will deepen defence ties with America in his second term. Japan is beefing up its armed forces and sending its navy into the South China Sea. Officials from America, Australia, India and Japan—the “Quad”—now confer routinely, most recently on May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All pay lip service to the idea that the Association of South-East Asian Nations (&lt;small&gt;ASEAN&lt;/small&gt;), a club of ten mostly smaller powers, should be at the core of &lt;small&gt;FOIP&lt;/small&gt;. The problem is that not all in &lt;small&gt;ASEAN&lt;/small&gt; are sold on the idea. For one thing, many are unconvinced that America will truly stick around, as the costs of any war with China grow over time. So why risk China’s ire? “The Chinese coast guard is bigger than Malaysia’s warships,” lamented Malaysia’s defence minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Shanahan did his best to assuage these concerns. He pointed out that the Indo-Pacific was America’s “priority theatre”, with four times as many American forces as any other American military command. America’s freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea were also growing more routine: unusually, there were two in May alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But muscle is only half of it. The larger issue is that Donald Trump’s unpredictably incendiary foreign policy sits uneasily with the principles of &lt;small&gt;FOIP&lt;/small&gt;. Tensions with Iran are pulling America’s attention back to the Middle East. The compulsive resort to tariffs undercuts a rules-based trading order. Mr Trump’s lack of interest in human rights hardly furthers freedom. And to many in Asia, America’s war on Huawei or its sanctions against buyers of Russian arms or Iranian oil look an awful lot like China’s “toolkit of coercion”, as Mr Shanahan put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is unfair. An Asian order sculpted by China would be more capricious and suffocating than anything Mr Trump could devise. General Wei’s defence of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests—he called it a “correct policy” that gave China the stability to grow richer—was a reminder of the ideological stakes. Australia, India and Japan are on board. Singapore and Vietnam’s sympathies are clear. But most &lt;small&gt;ASEAN&lt;/small&gt; countries hate the idea of taking sides, despite widespread misgivings about China’s intentions. Mr Shanahan reckons they will eventually come round: “I think they’re building up their confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:40:47 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The long-term decline in bond yields enters a new phase]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/06/06/the-long-term-decline-in-bond-yields-enters-a-new-phase]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_wbd003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-06T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 6th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;T THE END&lt;/small&gt; of 1989, an American in London received a call from a friend back home. The caller had watched the fall of the Berlin Wall and the toppling of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania with growing dismay. He was at the end of a four-year course in Russian Studies at an elite university with hefty tuition fees. He had learned all the Kremlinology a would-be cold warrior could need—but not that the cold war might suddenly end. “I just took a $60,000 bath,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story comes to mind not so much because of fears of a new cold war, this time with China, but because of the bond market’s recent response to such fears. Long-term interest rates have tumbled almost as swiftly as communism fell in Europe. The yield on a ten-year Treasury bond has plunged from 2.5% to 2.1% in the past month. Ten-year Bund yields have turned negative again and have reached a new all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens to long-term interest rates in large part reflects what is expected to happen to short-term rates. The bond market’s Kremlinologists expect the Federal Reserve to cut them soon. Other central banks will seek to keep money easy. One consequence is that the secular decline in real interest rates is unlikely to reverse soon (see chart). The implications are far-reaching: the whole edifice of asset prices is founded on a low-rate regime. But what if that regime were to come to an abrupt eventual end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190608_fnc198.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190608_fnc198.png 200w,

The reasons for their decades-long decline are not well understood or agreed upon. One school stresses an increased desire for saving. Demographic change is part of this story. As a large chunk of the rich world’s population approaches the end of their working lives, they seek to set aside more of their income for retirement. The integration of high-saving China into the world economy is another factor. In this view, long-term interest rates had to fall simply to clear the saturated global market for savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another school says that low bond yields are a distortion caused by the policies pursued by central banks in the rich world. They have kept short-term interest rates close to (or in some cases below) zero for much of the past decade. They have also spent trillions of dollars buying government bonds with the explicit goal of driving down long-term interest rates. In their defence, central bankers say they set interest rates to keep the economy purring. If they had pressed down too hard on the monetary pedal, the result ought to be a burst of rising prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of rising inflation it seems reasonable to expect that the era of low interest rates will last. If yields on the safest government bonds remain low, the expected returns on other assets—the earnings yield on equities, say, or the rental yield on property—should stay in line. The result would be that all assets will continue to look expensive relative to their long-run averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As logical as this seems, it is nevertheless disquieting. At some stage the influences that have pushed down yields will attenuate, even if this is not soon. Long-term interest rates will surely rise again. It is reasonable to believe that this will not be sudden. Demographic change happens slowly. So perhaps asset prices will adjust slowly to the new reality, whenever it dawns. But it is quite hard to imagine a world in which real interest rates grind upwards and asset-holders avoid taking a capital loss, says Shamik Dhar of &lt;small&gt;BNY &lt;/small&gt;Mellon, a fund-management group. The uncertainty about the timing of even a gradual adjustment creates headaches, for instance for someone hoping to own a home. Buy at the wrong time, and you end up with a house that slowly loses value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what if real interest rates rise a lot more quickly than they fell? Well, they might. China is already a spent force in the global savings glut: its current-account surplus has dwindled to next to nothing. Baby-boomers moving into retirement might step up their spending. If rich countries turn once again to fiscal policy as a tool for ginning up their economies, there are plenty of asset-heavy projects (airports, roads, fibre-optic networks) to soak up savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kremlinologists look for signs of shifting authority, for who’s up and who’s down. But when everyone is focused on who will be the next boss, they may all miss signs that the regime itself is cracking. For now, financial-market Kremlinologists are preoccupied with which assets to hold and which to avoid. But at some point capital will become scarcer. Somebody may find that they have taken an expensive bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Finance and economics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;Bath time for bonds&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:40:46 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
