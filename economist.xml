A notoriously troubled production, the film nevertheless went on to gross nearly $700m worldwide, making it the sixth-most-lucrative film of 2018. It was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor, an award which was won by its star, Rami Malek. The producers of “Rocketman” will be hoping that this bodes well for their film, another non-fiction drama about a theatrical and hedonistic British pop sensation, this time Elton John. Indeed, after the original director of “Bohemian Rhapsody” left the project, Dexter Fletcher was called in to supervise the last few weeks of shooting—and “Rocketman” is directed by Mr Fletcher, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the similarities, though, it would be astonishing if “Rocketman” sold anywhere near as many tickets as “Bohemian Rhapsody” did. That is not to suggest that it is a worse film. On the contrary, the main reason why this buoyant production may underperform is that it is bolder and less conventional, a full-blown musical rather than a biopic with songs. True, it ticks off all the usual scenes in the showbiz rise-and-fall genre—the meetings with key collaborators, the composing and recording of classic singles, triumphal concerts—but it does so with an impressionistic aplomb that “Bohemian Rhapsody” lacked. It discards realism in favour of razzmatazz, and slots in Mr John’s biggest hits as and when they suit the emotional arc of the story, whether the chronology is accurate or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rocketman” makes its intentions clear in its opening moments when the middle-aged Elton (Taron Egerton) struts down a corridor dressed as a bright orange devil, complete with bejewelled horns and feathery wings. He looks both heroic and utterly ridiculous, which is more or less how the film portrays him throughout. He sits down in a group therapy session and lists the many, many substances to which he is addicted. A counsellor asks him about his childhood, and we’re off: with terrific confidence and flair, Mr Fletcher stages a series of fantasy-tinged flashbacks which recount how a dumpy boy from suburban Middlesex named Reginald Dwight reinvented himself as a sequinned extrovert, how he became one of the world’s top-selling musicians, how he feared that being gay would result in a life of loneliness and how he sank into what the tabloids would call a “drugs hell”. (The film’s embrace of sex, drugs and swearing, incidentally, make “Bohemian Rhapsody” seem even more coy than it did already.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Fletcher is the ideal man for the job. As well as helping out on “Bohemian Rhapsody”, he has directed one previous jukebox musical, “Sunshine on Leith”, and one comic biopic starring Mr Egerton, “Eddie The Eagle”. The film’s screenwriter, Lee Hall, is the perfect choice, too: he is best known for his “Billy Elliot” screenplay, about a young ballet dancer from the north of England, and for the subsequent stage musical he co-wrote with Mr John himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their decision to turn Mr John’s life into what is effectively a stage musical is what makes “Rocketman” such ebullient fun, but also what stops it being as moving or as credible as it might have been. Jamie Bell (who starred in “Billy Elliot”) is restrained and soulful as Bernie Taupin, Mr Elton’s long-time lyricist and close friend, but otherwise the film is as bombastic as Mr John’s songs and as garish as his pantomime costumes. Mr Egerton, who sings all the songs himself, brings the requisite gusto, humour and vulnerability, but he isn’t exactly subtle; John Reid (Richard Madden), Mr John’s manager and lover, is evil incarnate; Mr Dwight, his domineering father (Steven Macintosh), is a parody of English reserve. And although Mr John’s bad behaviour is hardly ignored, “Rocketman”, on which the man himself is an executive producer and his husband, David Furnish, is the producer, insists that its insecure hero is more sinned against than sinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, these objections are probably beside the point. Nobody goes to see a musical about Elton John because they want nuance. They go because they want fireworks, and the film sets off plenty of those. If it had come out two years ago, it is “Rocketman” that would have exploded, and “Bohemian Rhapsody” would have fizzled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Rocketman” is released in Britain on May 22nd and in America on May 31st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:40:12 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why are Indians falling out of love with gold?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/05/20/why-are-indians-falling-out-of-love-with-gold]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190511_BLP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-20T14:08:31Z&quot;&gt;May 20th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE HINDU festival of Akshaya Tritiya, celebrated on May 7th this year, is considered an auspicious time to buy gold. Queues outside Indian jewellery stores become so long that makeshift tents are set up to accommodate the rush. Cashiers hand-count wads of banknotes in conditions as noisy as those in a busy fast-food restaurant. The salesmen cater to a remarkable level of demand. As a group, Indians buy more gold than anyone apart from the Chinese (who have occupied the top spot since 2014). Indian households are reckoned to have a stockpile of gold worth $800bn. Yet the Indian market is not as healthy as it was. Purchases of the metal have fallen by around a fifth since their peak in 2010. Why is gold losing its sheen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with changing tastes and preferences. Around a third of Indians are 18 to 35 years old. They often prefer to spend their money on electronic gadgets, purchased in monthly instalments on zero interest rates, rather than jewellery. In 2017 consumer electronics toppled gold as the second-biggest contributor to India’s national import bill, behind oil. Moreover, the tastes of those who buy gold appear to be changing. Heavy jewellery has given way to lightweight designs, sometimes with lesser caratage. “Gold is no longer a sign of wealth but of fashion,” admits one customer at a jewellery store in Mumbai. As if to confirm this, in February the price of gold rose almost to a five-year high, dampening its allure as a store of value. This discourages those customers who would buy 22-carat bling, the purest gold suitable for jewellery, with a view to melting and reselling it at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold is no longer the go-to investment option for those whose money lies outside the formal financial system. In 2014 a state-sponsored programme opened millions of bank accounts. Mutual funds have returned 12.5% annually in the last decade. The Sensex stockmarket index has gained around 60% in the past five years. In that period, the price of gold rose, in rupee terms, by just 7% from a high base, a far cry from the 12 years until 2012 when it rose by over 500%. Its value as a hedge against inflation, at 3%, has diminished too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s government has long tried to wean citizens off gold, almost all of which the country imports. This burns a hole in the current-account deficit, and a depreciating rupee further weakens the balance of payments. Since 2012 officials have raised quotas on gold imports five-fold to 10%, but are wary of increasing the rate higher, lest they push the trade underground. Last year authorities seized 66kg of gold bars, worth $3m, hidden in four cars. Bootleggers will continue to seek creative ways to beat the system. But if consumers are reconsidering their love affair with gold, the government will not try to rekindle the passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 22:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The management wisdom of Bill Campbell]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/20/the-management-wisdom-of-bill-campbell]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190518_wbp507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-20T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 20th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;AS YOGI BERRA, a legendary Yankees baseball player, coach and master of malapropisms, once said, “Baseball is 90% mental and the other half is physical.” Managers might need a better grasp of maths than Berra. But they require a similar focus on instilling the right mentality, not just in themselves but in their team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That view is held particularly strongly by three Google executives—Eric Schmidt (a former director of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;), Jonathan Rosenberg and Alan Eagle—who have written a book in praise of their mentor, Bill Campbell. His influence on Silicon Valley was so profound that they have called the book “Trillion Dollar Coach”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most outsiders will not have heard of Campbell, who began his career as a college coach of American football. Later, he worked at Apple, heading the marketing campaign for the original Macintosh, and then became chief executive at Intuit, a financial-software company. But his most effective role was in the background, as a board member at Apple (and close friend of Steve Jobs) and as a coach to companies backed by Kleiner Perkins, a venture-capital firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google was one of Kleiner’s investments and when Mr Schmidt was appointed chief executive of the company in 2001, Kleiner’s John Doerr suggested that he recruit Campbell as his coach. Although Mr Schmidt was initially reluctant to accept the need for coaching, he learned to value Campbell’s advice. In 2004 Campbell helped to persuade the Google boss not to quit when his roles as chairman and chief executive were split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell acted as an unpaid mentor at Google until his death in 2016. He also coached executives at eBay, Facebook and Twitter, among others. In 2000 he advised the Amazon board not to replace Jeff Bezos as chief executive of the e-commerce company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a coach, Campbell’s role was not to be in charge of particular projects, or to make strategic decisions, but to make other people work better. Although he advised individuals, his focus was on ensuring that teams were able to co-operate properly. His motto was that “your title makes you a manager, your people make you a leader.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was happy to dish out praise in group meetings, and was a generous man in his spare time, he was not a soft touch. He simply believed in giving harsh feedback in private, and was usually adept enough to make the recipient grateful for the telling-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he talked to people, he gave them his undivided attention; the discussions were never interrupted and he never checked his smartphone. But coaching had to be a two-way process. Some people were temperamentally incapable of responding properly. To be coachable, Campbell believed, managers need to be honest, humble and willing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sign of his unique personality is that he has not been replaced since he died. Instead Google is attempting to incorporate his principles into the way the company is run. All managers should, in part, be coaches. The idea seems to be gaining popularity. In their book, “It’s the Manager”, Jim Clifton and Jim Harter of Gallup, a polling organisation, include a whole section called “Boss to Coach”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is linked to the importance of employee engagement. Gallup cites research showing that when managers involve employees in setting their own work goals, the latter are four times more likely to report feeling engaged. Managers are responsible for 70% of the variance in how engaged employees were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary job of any manager is to help people be more effective in their job. One benefit should be that workers will stay with the company; the main reason they change jobs, according to what they tell Gallup, is for “career growth opportunities”. Workers should get regular feedback from their managers—daily if possible, surveys show. An annual performance review is of little use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this approach will only work if it comes from the top down. Middle managers tend to emulate their superiors and to respond to incentives; they will coach underlings if this behaviour is reinforced and rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, even the best coaches and managers have to give their employees scope to find their own way, and make their own mistakes. As Yogi Berra put it, “I’m not going to buy my kids an encyclopedia. Let them walk to school like I did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 21:40:17 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“They’re more legitimate than the government”—the Taliban in Afghanistan]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/05/20/theyre-more-legitimate-than-the-government-the-taliban-in-afghanistan]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/afghanistan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-20T11:30:32Z&quot;&gt;May 20th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFGHANISTAN&amp;#x27;S GOVERNMENT still struggles for legitimacy after 18 years and almost a trillion dollars spent fighting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/asia/2019/05/18/why-afghanistans-government-is-losing-the-war-with-the-taliban&quot;&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;; we ask why.

Simon &amp;amp; Schuster; £20&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONICA SMITH begins her provocative and engaging tour of 6,000 years of “crowd-based living” with a question: Why cities? The problems that arise from packing too many people into too small a space range from inadequate food supply and housing to unmanageable waste, not to mention disease, crime and the daily indignities of living on top of the neighbours. These difficulties began in ancient Mesopotamia, the Indus river valley, and in the sprawling metropolises of the Mayan and Aztec empires. And yet people continue to flock to urban centres, leaving friends and family behind to risk an uncertain future among strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, says Ms Smith, an archaeologist, is that cities are where the species fulfils its destiny. In Mexicali, to take one evocative example, young rural migrants call the move to the city “buscar la vida” (“to seek life”). Cities offer not only increased economic opportunity but also the possibility of reinvention. People who struggled to fit in when they lived in the countryside can often find in a city others who share their values or interests. In a village, “all the ties are strong (in some cases suffocatingly so)”, whereas in cities people “align with their commonalities rather than divide according to their differences”. Living among strangers is not a cause for despair but a chance to throw off the shackles of custom and kinship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, city life can sometimes be unpleasant. The hustle can foster anxiety. Disease can spread easily in congested neighbourhoods. Newcomers sometimes find themselves no better off than they were in the countryside. All these problems were as familiar in imperial Rome as in Brazil’s favelas today. But Ms Smith is an optimist—perhaps to a fault. Even the worst blights, such as shanty towns and overflowing landfills are, for her, as much cause for celebration as worry. Admitting that much of the urban landscape consists of slums, she insists that “the steady influx of people to these areas of abject poverty demonstrates that even when city life is very unattractive, there’s still plenty that draws people in.” Waste is testament to “the spirit of consumption that has been part and parcel of every urban centre ever known”. Cast-offs are the byproduct of self-expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recurrent theme is the continuity of urban life across both time and space. When the conquistadors encountered the metropolises of the New World, they felt an instant sense of recognition. There were the same broad thoroughfares and marketplaces, grand religious buildings and crowded slums. Ms Smith thinks their “experiences with New World cities like Tenochtitlan and Cuzco provide the nearest thing to a laboratory condition for capturing the universality of the urban form”. Cities, she concludes, are often alike because they are all designed for the same purpose. People like to mingle with other people. Cities let that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 19:40:55 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner decides she wants to be vice-president, not president]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/05/19/cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-decides-she-wants-to-be-vice-president-not-president]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_blp906.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-19T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 19th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAYS BEFORE she is due to go on trial for corruption, Argentina’s former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, has re-written the script for this year’s election, due in October. On May 18th Ms Fernández announced that she would not be running for president, contrary to what she had signaled only days before. Instead, she said, she was asking her chief adviser Alberto Fernández (no relation) to be the candidate for the top job, and she will be the vice-presidential nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never have we had so many people sleeping on the street, never so many looking for food and work,” Ms Fernández said, attacking the government of the current president, Mauricio Macri. She explained that her new team was designed “not just to win an election, but to govern.” The news astonished some within her own Peronist movement—another former president, Eduardo Duhalde, said he thought it was “a joke” when he first heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Fernández acknowledged that she had not always agreed with Mr Fernández. He was chief of staff to her late husband Néstor Kirchner during his Presidency from 2003 to 2007, and served her in the same position for a few months after she came to power in late 2007. Mr Fernández is known as a wily, backroom operative, but few have any sense of his own agenda. Speaking to journalists outside his home, he said he was ready to work on solving the “immeasurable crisis” the country faces. He insisted his running mate had been the victim of the “judicial system…..a shameful process, a judicial battering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even allowing for the unusual way in which the vice-presidential pick chose the presidential nominee, Argentines find the choice of Mr Fernández surprising. He has never run for public office on his own, and his time in elected office is limited to serving in the Buenos Aires city legislature from 2000 to 2003 on a party list. Pollsters say they have never taken soundings on the man’s electability, or name-recognition, or attractiveness to the electorate. “In an election year as unpredictable as this, Alberto is a wild card that only Cristina could come up with,” says one political consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Macri, who is facing a tough re-election campaign as recession, 56% inflation and rising unemployment turn voters against him, confined himself to saying that “to return to figures of the past will be self-destruction.” But prominent supporters within his Cambiemos movement were more forthright. Elisa Carrió, once a presidential candidate herself, for her Civic Coalition, tweeted about the new candidate: “They are proposing Jack the Ripper. He guarantees them all impunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within the new Fernández-Fernández camp, there are those who acknowledge that the former president had been weighed down by the prospect of her public trial this week. On May 21st she is due to appear with members of her government, some already behind bars, on corruption charges allegedly involving millions of dollars of state funds and unfinished public works in her home state of Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alfredo Cornejo, the leader of the Radical party, governor of Mendoza and a key figure within Mr Macri’s Cambiemos alliance, suggested that Ms Fernández had chosen someone she can control, and that she plans to run the country from the position of vice-president and protect herself and her family from prosecution. “It’s all about her warding off the trials she faces for the high level of corruption in her government. It’s all about impunity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fernández-Fernández ticket will now seek to unify the Peronist movement, and bring in moderates who have been challenging Ms Fernández for the Peronist mantle in August primaries ahead of October’s elections. One well-known Peronist candidate, Sergio Massa, another former chief of staff to Ms Fernández, expressed a willingness to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one will be watching more closely than the International Monetary Fund, which agreed to lend Argentina a record $57bn last year. Mr Fernández insisted he had “no fear” of negotiating a way out: “the ideal would be that we find an exit that meets the commitments Argentina has with the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 22:40:12 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don’t talk (too much) about religion at work]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/05/19/dont-talk-too-much-about-religion-at-work]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190525_blp902.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-19T12:56:33Z&quot;&gt;May 19th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;BY HER own lights, Sarah Kuteh was evidently convinced that she was doing the right thing. But some of the patients who were interviewed by this devoutly Christian nurse, as they were being prepared for big operations, felt disturbed by her insistence on bringing up her beliefs. One man, facing cancer treatment, said she offered him a Bible and induced him to sing part of a Biblical Psalm with her. It felt like a scene out of Monty Python, an old British comedy show, he complained later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week a British employment-law judge reaffirmed that a hospital in the south-east of England had been acting within its rights when it dismissed Ms Kuteh after she persisted, despite warnings, in having rather assertive religious conversations with patients. (It was sometimes part of her job to ask patients what religion, if any, they professed, but she had been told to keep such enquiries very brief.) The verdict was a nuanced one, though, which made clear that its aim was not to ban all talk of religion from the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain and most other democracies, law and jurisprudence have tried to achieve a careful balance between two things: first, upholding freedom of speech, and the freedom to practise and indeed advocate one’s beliefs; and second, people’s desire to be protected from unwanted or even bullying proselytism, especially when they are in vulnerable situations. Also part of the mix is the natural concern, and indeed duty, of employers to avoid religious discord in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, a conditional right to proselytise (in the sense of advocating the truth of one’s religion) was affirmed by a famous judgment of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights, the so-called Kokkinakis case, adjudicated in 1993. As was to be expected, lawyers for Ms Kuteh brought up that case, which vindicated a Greek Jehovah’s Witness. (He had been convicted of illegal proselytising, a criminal offence in Greece, after engaging a woman neighbour in a religious discussion which she found confusing; her husband, an Orthodox church chanter, went to the police.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as this week’s British ruling observed, the Kokkinakis verdict had made an important distinction between “bearing Christian witness” and “improper proselytism”. As the Strasbourg verdict specified, the latter might take the form of “offering material or social advantages with a view to gaining new members for a church or exerting improper pressure on people in distress or in need; it may even entail the use of violence or brainwashing.” And on the face of things, “exerting improper pressure on people in distress or in need” is a rather accurate description of the activities that were at issue in Ms Kuteh’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, where religious faith and the sanctity of free speech are generally held in higher regard than in some parts of Europe, there is a similar struggle to achieve a balance. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that upholds anti-discrimination law, warns employers that if one worker is allowed to preach aggressively to another, that can give the targeted worker grounds to sue the bosses for allowing a hostile work environment. But in practice that doesn’t preclude a bit of casual chat about matters of belief over the water-cooler.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the constitution, the key legislation in America is the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which tells bosses to give “reasonable accommodation” to their workers’ religious needs as long as doing so does not bring about “undue hardship” for the firm or organisation. A worker who creates an atmosphere of sectarian strife, or falsely implies to the world that an employer is associated with a particular faith, could certainly be accused of causing “undue hardship”, the case law suggests. This implies that a discreet religious sign at a workstation deep inside a building is okay, but a receptionist putting the same sign above the desk seen by everybody entering the premises would be out of line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark case in 1996 upheld the dismissal of a devoutly Christian worker at a firm in Richmond, Virginia, after she told her supervisor to “get right with God” and warned a subordinate that she was sinning gravely by conceiving a child out of wedlock. But gentler religious language, such as wishing fellow workers a “blessed day”, has been found to be permissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In American cases where the employer is the government, another consideration comes into play: the constitutional ban on the state establishment of any particular faith. In recent times this has been interpreted quite broadly to bar any overt identification by any agency of the state, whether administrative or judicial, with a particular metaphysical viewpoint. So in a case from 2001, when a nursing consultant in Connecticut was dismissed for her habit of preaching on the job, the state’s Health Department successfully used the argument that its employees had to present a religiously neutral face to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bosses looking for a simple rule of thumb to handle religious issue in the work-place won’t find one. International human-rights norms, including the European Convention on Human Rights, affirm the right  to manifest one’s beliefs, in public and private. Given the harsh persecution which rages in many parts of the word, that is not a trivial entitlement. But as is noted by Tom Heys, an employment laywer with the London firm of Lewis Silkin, “There is often a fine line between…the manifestation of a belief and its inappropriate promotion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 20:39:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe&#x27;s hard-right is pitching voters a contradictory fantasy]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/18/europes-hard-right-is-pitching-voters-a-contradictory-fantasy]]></link><description>&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-18T20:35:02Z&quot;&gt;May 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EUROPE’S right-wing populists will take votes off an array of mainstream rivals at next weekend’s election to the European Parliament. But what exactly do they want? To that, the nationalists provided answers of sorts at their big end-of-campaign rally in Milan’s Piazza del Duomo today. Under sporadic rain showers in the shadow of the city’s cathedral, right-populist leaders from eleven EU countries demanded a “revolution” to overthrow the existing order in Brussels and build a “Europe of nations”. They were confident. They were loud. They reaped the applause of thousands of supporters of Italy’s hard-right Lega, the host party, gathered in the square waving giant flags in the drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;They were also incoherent to the point of parody. Europe’s hard right is going through something of a transformation. Time was, these people straightforwardly disliked the EU and often wanted to pull their member states out of it. But support for the union among voters has risen, common threats loom larger and Britain has made a terrible mess of Brexit, putting off would-be copycats. Meanwhile rising anti-establishment and anti-migrant sentiments in much of Europe have blurred the boundaries between the nationalists and the mainstream. A new, hybrid sort of European nationalist populism is emerging that attempts to be subtler than the old “yah boo to Europe” sort. Matteo Salvini, the League’s leader and Italy’s deputy prime minister, wants to organise a new group around this idea in the next European Parliament.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Hence the Europe-of-nations bluster from the speakers. A common theme was that the EU is not innately a bad thing. It is just run by the wrong people (decadent, politically correct bureaucratic types) and to the wrong ends (letting in Muslim immigrants and cozying up to bankers). That, went the argument, was destroying ancient European nations and endangering and impoverishing their peoples. With the right people in charge (the nationalist populists and especially “Matteo”) and the right goals (giving powers back to member states and shielding ordinary people from Muslims, criminals, bankers and the like) the EU could help defend the autonomy of nation states and the security of their peoples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;“It is up to us,” said Tomio Okamura, leader of the Czech far-right, “to decide whether Europe should remain European or whether Merkel, Juncker and Macron [cue boos from the crowd] will be able to Islamise Europe.” Jörg Meuthen of Alternative for Germany issued a shopping list including a leaner EU, powers returned to national governments, more free trade, more security for citizens and a “Fortress Europe” on migration. Then came Geert Wilders, a Dutch populist: “No more dictates from the EU superstate…The political elites in Brussels can’t be trusted. They want to take away our identity and our security.” Georg Mayer from the Freedom Party of Austria praised Mr Salvini (and said precisely nothing about the contracts-for-support scandal consuming Heinz Christian Strache, his party leader and Austria’s then vice chancellor, back in Vienna.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;The star of the show—her operatic rhetorical flourishes unmatched by other speakers, including a rambling Mr Salvini—was Marine Le Pen of France’s National Rally. She pledged to fight “savage globalisation” and proposed adapting the first line of France’s anthem (“Arise, children of the fatherland”) and making “Arise, children of the fatherlands” the motto of the Europe-of-nations that would emerge from the “peaceful revolution” launched here in Milan. “Our Europe is not 70 years old but millennia old,” she bellowed, citing the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, Milan’s Duomo, Leonardo da Vinci and myriad other artists, writers and philosophers as examples of this common continental culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Which all sounded, from a collection of nationalists, rather European. Indeed, several speakers emphasised the point: “We are not anti-Europeans as the mainstream claims,” protested Mr Meuthen: “We are the true Europeans. We are against the current Europe and its current elites.” Talk of leaving the EU, of Frexit or Nexit or Öxit, has gone. In its place is the assertion that with a change of guard in Brussels and more “common sense” (a frequently occurring buzzword that none of the speakers troubled to unpack) it will be possible to dodge trade-offs between collective European action and individual national autonomy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Yet those trade-offs were revealed in all the unanswered questions about this brave new Europe-of-nations. If national identities are uniquely sacred, for example, then why were so many Lega supporters in the crowd flying regional flags? Why did one band of them describe themselves as “Tuscan nationalists”? Why did so many banners bear the “Sun of the Alps” design associated with the separatism of Padania, or the northern Italian regions, for the rest of Italy? (Partial answer: the Lega was until recently for Padanian autonomy from Italy’s poorer south). And why did several speakers wax lyrical about a common European identity? If Leonardo da Vinci and Joan of Arc belong to Europe as a whole as well as to their respective nations, as Ms Le Pen seemed to claim, then perhaps national identities are more fluid and intertwined than the nationalist ideal preached in other parts of the speeches allowed. “Viva l’Europa” said several speakers in accented Italian in their perorations, comparing the continent to a living being in a fashion they might have been expected to reserve for their precious nation states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;The conceptual muddles underwrote the more practical contradictions in the prospectus advanced on the Piazza del Duomo. Does protecting the nation stage mean more market discipline, as Mr Meuthen’s free-trade overtures and Mr Salvini’s tax-slashing promises demanded, or less, as Ms Le Pen’s anti-globalisation arguments seemed to suggest? Wouldn’t building a “Fortress Europe” with a common security architecture—plus the general “togetherness” of European action that most speakers seemed to favour—take the union farther in the direction of a superstate and away from nation-state autonomy? Who exactly belonged to these decadent anti-nationalist elites and establishments that the speakers attacked? Were nationalists involved in running their own nation states, like Mr Salvini, exempt from the anti-nation states “elites” label? And what about those nationalists, like Mr Strache, seemingly willing to sell out the interests of their nation state for that of another, namely Russia?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;The lack of clarity on all this contained an awkward truth: even for the nationalists, it turns out, the nation state is one ideal among many. It is relative, and contested, and rather messy. Sometimes advancing its interests involve trade-offs with other ideals and priorities. Sometimes other layers of identity and power are also important and even more relevant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Europe’s nationalists have a method for avoiding these complexities: they reduce debates to personalities. Many of the speakers name-checked Mr Salvini to win applause and Angela Merkel, Jean-Claude Juncker, Emmanuel Macron and other mainstreamers to elicit boos. Mr Salvini went a step further and turned chunks of his speech into a sort of power point presentation, flashing up images of historical figures who had, apparently, respected nation states where others had not. These included Pope Jean Paul II, Margaret Thatcher, Alcide de Gasperi and Charles De Gaulle. Never mind the crashing contradictions contained in the list: these were the pro-nation-states good guys, the others were the bad guys. A Europe-of-nations is whatever the good guys want and whatever the bad ones do not want. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;All of which snake oil might work in an election campaign. But afterwards, once a new Parliament is formed, things will become trickier, when a Europe-of-nations will pass from being a political slogan to the supposed organising ideal of a new political block. The parties represented on the stage in Milan have different positions on Russia and China, on migrant quotas, on trade and industrial policies, on the EU’s border regime, on Brexit and on the environment and agricultural policies. They will disagree on many big touchstone topics. So the chances of a consolidated hard-right block forming successfully after the next parliament are low. Today, Europe’s nationalists proudly claim that with a Europe-of-nations they have found a way to square national interests and national autonomy painlessly. But soon enough they will prove that they are just as incapable of doing that as the mainstream elites against whom they fulminate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 06:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A conservative government is returned to power in Australia]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/05/18/a-conservative-government-is-returned-to-power-in-australia]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_blp903.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-18T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CHANGE OF government had seemed almost guaranteed. The right-leaning Liberal Party, and their smaller coalition partners, the Nationals, had been in power for six tumultuous years. Ever since the previous election, three years ago, they had trailed the Labor Party in the opinion polls. The opposition’s private tallies had left it almost certain of victory. But the results of the election on May 18th have surprised everyone: the conservatives have been returned for a third term in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Votes are still being counted, and some constituencies remain too close to call, but the national broadcaster estimates that the coalition has picked up 74 of 151 seats in the House of Representatives, compared with Labor’s 66. It would need two more seats to form a majority, and will otherwise govern in a hung parliament (as it did before this election). “I have always believed in miracles,” sang the prime minister, Scott Morrison (pictured), who is an evangelical Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A miracle it may be. Liberal MPs had ejected two sitting prime ministers during their six years in power. The removal nine months ago of Malcolm Turnbull, a relative moderate, had seemed to jeopardise the Liberals’ already wobbly standing with voters, who punished the party for its continual in-fighting in a recent state election and in several by-elections. But Australians’ anger has apparently abated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has veered hard to the right under Mr Morrison. He promised little beyond more jobs, lower income taxes and a continuation of Australia’s 28 years of economic growth. Perhaps more importantly, he whipped up fear about the economic consequences of Labor’s plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and to close tax loopholes for the rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to have won the coalition favour in Queensland, a state with a population scarcely bigger than that of Sydney or Melbourne, but with disproportionate influence on politics as Australia’s main swing state. It is home to most of Australia’s coal mines, which leaves many locals wary of environmental regulation. Labor had hoped to win some marginal seats in the state. Instead, voters turned out in even greater force for the Liberals than they had at the previous federal election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Liberals won several marginal seats in Queensland from Labor, helped by votes funnelled from smaller nativist parties under Australia’s system of preferential voting. The hardline immigration minister, Peter Dutton, who initiated the coup against Mr Turnbull last year, had feared being ejected from parliament. In the end he retained his seat with a bigger margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may have helped that the conservatives supported a controversial plans for a big new coal mine owned by an Indian conglomerate, Adani. Labor had hummed and hawed about its future, and pledged to generate more of Australia’s electricity from renewable sources. The party had hoped such green stances would help it win seats in Victoria, a far more progressive state. It had won a state election there last year in a landslide. But in this election, Victorians only swung two percentage points in Labor’s direction. In the end, no seats in that state seem to have changed hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not help that Labor’s leader, Bill Shorten, was unpopular. He immediately stood down, tearfully conceding that he was “hurting”. Mr Morrison polls better. He had portrayed himself as a bumbling soccer dad, throwing out Australianisms at every turn. That made some urbanites cringe. But his studied everyman persona may have helped clinch blue-collar votes in Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Liberals suffered only one major upset: in Sydney’s wealthy northern beaches, Tony Abbott, a former Liberal prime minister and the leader of the party’s right wing, was ejected from parliament after 25 years. He once called climate change “crap” and pushed for Australia to quit the Paris Agreement, which aims to reduce global emissions. That left him out of step with his more environmentally minded constituents, who voted in an independent candidate, Zali Steggall, with a monumental swing of more than 12%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change is taking place in Australian politics, Mr Abbott surmised, that will seem familiar to Americans. The Liberals increasingly represent the working classes, while wealthier, city-dwelling conservatives are turning to more progressive politicians. Politics also seem to hinge more on atavistic distinctions than on policies. There has also been one other change that works in Mr Morrison’s favour. The Liberal party has modified its rules to make it harder to turf out sitting prime ministers. So unlike his predecessors, he should have three uninterrupted years to convince voters that they made the right decision when picking him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 04:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scandal fells the vice-chancellor of Austria]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/05/18/scandal-fells-the-vice-chancellor-of-austria]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190525_blp905.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-18T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANY VISITORS to Ibiza do things they regret. But rarely do they involve dodgy discussions with wealthy Russians over procurement contracts and sales of stakes in newspapers. On May 18th Heinz-Christian Strache (pictured), the leader of Austria’s hard-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), resigned as the country’s vice-chancellor after a stunning exposé published overnight by German media suggested that he had been prepared to manipulate the Austrian state to help his party’s fortunes. “Enough is enough,” declared Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor, a few hours later, calling time on the government and announcing an early general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a boozy evening at a rented villa on the Spanish island in July 2017, three months before an Austrian general election, Mr Strache and Johann Gudenus, an ally, met “Alyona Makarova”, a young woman who claimed to be the niece of a Russian oligarch, and a companion. Over champagne, sushi and copious amounts of Red Bull, Mr Strache appears to have offered to help his interlocutor gain access to juicy state highway contracts once he joined the government. In exchange, Ms Makarova would take a 50% stake in the Kronen Zeitung, a popular Austrian tabloid, and help reinvent it as an FPÖ mouthpiece. Such a turn, enthused Mr Strache, could lift his party’s support from 27% to 34%. On several occasions during the conversation Mr Strache vowed not to do anything illegal. But seven hours of footage, some of which has been made public, finds the FPÖ pair musing on the possibility of building a media landscape modelled on Hungary’s, thinking about ways to circumvent party-donation rules, and lamenting the West’s “decadence”—before decamping to a nightclub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact the whole operation was an elaborate sting. At an emotional appearance before the press Mr Strache apologised for his “extremely embarrassing statements”, blaming “typical alcohol-fuelled macho posturing” and a desire to impress his “attractive hostess”. Yet he said he was resigning only to save the reputation of the government (in which the FPÖ had served as junior coalition partner to Mr Kurz’s People’s Party, or ÖVP), defiantly asserting that the only illegal action in Ibiza was the filming of his meeting. He hinted at dark conspiracies behind the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the set-up remains unclear. Whoever was behind it mounted a sophisticated operation, including the courting of Mr Gudenus before the meeting, the installation of cameras and microphones throughout the Ibiza apartment, and, after sitting on the footage for nearly two years, a leak to the German press that was presumably designed to harm Mr Strache in the run-up to next week’s European election. Der Spiegel and Süddeutsche Zeitung, the German publications that ran the story, say their source insists on anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Strache’s political career is surely over. But Mr Kurz finds himself in a tricky spot. After inviting the FPÖ, a party with a long history of flirtation with neo-Nazism, to join the ÖVP in government in 2017, Mr Kurz promised anxious European allies that he could tame his coalition partner’s more extreme instincts. That proposition has lately been tested; some governments have halted intelligence co-operation with Austria amid concerns over the FPÖ-led interior ministry’s links with Russia, and a stream of mini-scandals has highlighted the extremism that the party still harbours in its ranks. Now Mr Strache’s antics have punched a giant hole in Mr Kurz’s argument that the best way to manage the far-right is to co-opt them. In the short term the ÖVP is well placed to fight an election. Mr Kurz remains personally popular, and the third force in Austria, the Social Democrats, have struggled in opposition. But forming a coalition without either may prove hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal has also troubled Mr Strache’s friends outside Austria. Today Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and the leader of its populist Lega party, held a large rally in Milan, flanked by Marine Le Pen and other avatars of Europe’s nationalist right, as part of a joint campaign for the European elections. A senior politician from the FPÖ had been due to join them, but had to cancel at the last minute. The usually loquacious Mr Salvini had nothing to say about his erstwhile ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/05/18/the-european-parliament-elections-are-responding-to-a-changed-world&quot;&gt;The European Parliament elections are responding to a changed world (May 16th 2019)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 04:39:56 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
