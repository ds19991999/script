There is no middle ground.” Cersei Lannister’s binary prediction, made eight years and 62 episodes ago during the first season of TV drama “Game of Thrones”, is looking prescient. With just four episodes left, a major battle looks set to wipe out many of the show’s remaining characters. And not all survivors would have much chance of taking a seat upon the Iron Throne as the ruler of Westeros when the final season ends, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://markets.predictwise.com/entertainment/game-of-thrones&quot;&gt;bookmakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early front-runner Bran Stark, no stranger to falling, has plummeted from favour with bettors, while his sister Sansa’s chances have nearly doubled over the past two episodes. A new “battle of the bastards” is taking place between Gendry and Jon Snow in third and fourth place, even as the latter’s true heritage starts to cause problems with his beloved aunt. And as is fitting for a show with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/07/24/what-is-the-moral-compass-of-game-of-thrones&quot;&gt;meandering moral compass&lt;/a&gt;, the two players who most want to win, Cersei and Daenerys Targaryen, have little hope, at least if the wisdom of crowds is to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More on “Game of Thrones”:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.1843magazine.com/culture/the-daily/game-of-loans&quot;&gt;The economics of “Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.1843magazine.com/culture/the-daily/how-to-win-the-game-of-thrones&quot;&gt;How to win the “Game of Thrones”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/prospero/2016/06/27/women-rule-westeros-how-strange&quot;&gt;Women rule Westeros.

That is more a statement of the obvious. Since a calendar reform of the 1920s, Christians of the east have been divided over when to celebrate say, Christmas; but virtually all, whether in Muscovite cathedrals or tiny Balkan villages, mark Easter on the same date (often, as this year, different from the western one) and in broadly the same style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a style that stresses inclusivity. The service features a famous sermon by Archbishop John Chrysostom (c349-407) which invites everybody to the Easter feast, whether they have fasted rigorously or only a little or not at all: “The table is lavishly laden, let all enjoy it sumptuously!” Elsewhere in the prayers, there are exhortations like: “Let us embrace one another! Let us say…even to those who hate us, may all be pardoned in the light of the Resurrection!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this warm and forgiving background, people were watching closely for any slight mending of a split within the Orthodox world which has been described by one of the protagonists, the Patriarchate of Moscow, as the bitterest inter-Orthodox division for many centuries. It concerns the proclamation in January of an independent Ukrainian church, with the blessing of the Istanbul-based Patriarch of Constantinople, who traditionally enjoys “primacy of honour” in world Orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a thundering retaliation for what it called encroachment on its canonical territory, the Moscow Patriarchate severed relations with the Istanbul-based hierarch, Bartholomew I, and told its flock not to receive the sacraments (supremely sacred church rites) in places under his authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks and over Easter, there have been signs of things getting just a little bit easier, or at least of people learning to live with deep disagreement. A change at the top may help. The politician who spearheaded the creation of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), Petro Poroshenko, lost last weekend’s presidential elections to a comic actor, Volodymyr Zelensky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Muscovite hierarchy apparently sees this as an opportunity for a fresh start. Patriarch Kirill sent the new head of state a warm letter of congratulation and his Easter message contained no vituperation over Ukraine. As a practising Orthodox Christian, Mr Poroshenko had been passionately involved in church affairs and staked his unsuccessful election campaign on a slogan of “army, language and faith”. Mr Zelensky, who is Jewish, has less obvious interest in inter-Orthodox disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those disputes rumble on. Muscovites complain that parishes loyal to Kirill are being taken over improperly by Ukrainian nationalists. The OCU retorts that any transfers are voluntary. Whatever the circumstances, about 500 congregations have switched allegiance from the Patriarchate of Moscow to the OCU; that probably leaves around 11,000 communities in Muscovite hands, against nearly 8,000 for the OCU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the church which Mr Poroshenko helped to found was proud to celebrate its first Easter since receiving the Tomos, a document issued in Istanbul that certifies its independence. Perhaps a little crestfallen, the former president stood near the front as Metropolitan Epifaniy, the 40-year-old primate of the new church, led the Resurrection chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was also the first year in which the independent Ukrainian church participated in one of the most spectacular Easter rituals that bind the Orthodox world together. As soon as the “Holy Fire” symbolising the Resurrection is kindled in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, usually on Saturday afternoon, the flames (or rather lanterns kindled from the flame) are swiftly transported to Orthodox communities near and far. Palestinian Christians drum the fire through their streets, while planes whisk flickering lamps to places like Greece, Cyprus, Russia—and, as of 2019, Ukraine. It was brought to Saint Michael’s Cathedral in Kiev by a group of 30 volunteers, including some war veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Istanbul, meanwhile, Patriarch Bartholomew solemnly prayed for all the other leaders of Orthodox churches, including Moscow’s Kirill and Kiev’s Epifaniy, as he led the four-hour overnight service. Mr Zelensky was reported to have headed to Turkey for a short holiday but he was not to be seen at the Patriarchate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other ways, though, he seems to have entered the paschal spirit. He had upset the leaders of the new Ukrainian church by waggishly comparing their beloved Tomos, or certificate of religious freedom, with a thermos, which in Slavic languages as well as English refers to a humdrum device for keeping drinks at a stable temperature. But over the weekend, leaders of the OCU said the new President had apologised for his joke and they had warmly forgiven him; they wished him well with his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2019 23:07:20 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[America’s strong growth this year surprises economists]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/04/26/americas-strong-growth-this-year-surprises-economists]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_USP511.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-26T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 26th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIS YEAR America’s economy did not get the freshest of starts. A government shutdown, a wobbly stockmarket and concerns that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy too quickly made for a dim outlook for 2019. With the effects of fiscal stimulus fading, and momentum in the global economy ebbing, most expected America’s economic growth to decelerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So GDP figures for the first quarter, published on April 26th, were a pleasant surprise. Economists surveyed by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; had been expecting annualised real growth for the quarter of 2.5%. Instead they were treated to a figure of 3.2%. Needless to say, President Donald Trump was pleased, tweeting that the figure was “far above expectations or projections”, and (of course) adding “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president got an impressive number to hurl at his critics, who had doubted that his economic plans would generate sustained rapid growth. The headline figure also seemed to defy fears of a looming downturn. Markets predict an interest-rate cut this year. But an economy growing at such a healthy clip seems, at face value, unlikely to need such support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dig a little deeper, though, and the details are less rosy. Around one percentage point of that 3.2% was because of falling imports and rising exports, a volatile component of GDP. Another 0.7 percentage points came from changes in inventories, which could unwind later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other components of GDP looked soft. Consumer spending, an engine of growth through most of last year, grew by just 1.2% on an annualised basis, or less than half its rate in the fourth quarter of 2018. It was pulled down by an 18% decline in spending on cars and car parts. Investment data also looked a little soggy, with the exception of investment in intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this weakness should reverse in the second quarter of 2019. The government shutdown probably did crimp performance, but is now over. And though retail sales went through a soft patch around the turn of the year, they seem to be picking up. And the GDP figures come with a standard caveat: they are preliminary estimates, which will be revised at least twice in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more consequential than the eye-catching growth figure was unexpectedly weak inflation, which could suggest an underlying weakness in demand. Annualised quarterly growth in prices, as measured by personal-consumption expenditures, was just 0.6%, or 1.3% when excluding (volatile) energy and food. This sting in the tail is probably why government bond yields, which rose on news of the cheering GDP figure, then fell sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monetary policymakers at the Fed are due to meet next week, and some may conclude from today’s release that they raised interest rates too aggressively in 2018, and are therefore to blame for disappointing domestic demand. The weakness of inflation certainly suggests that monetary policy has not been too loose. A more constructive conclusion might be that the Fed was right to shift to a more doveish stance in the past few months, and that low inflation leaves it well placed to apply more stimulus if necessary. Official projections at its last meeting suggested that interest rates would not rise again this year. With inflation still quiescent, there seems no reason that would change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 05:12:24 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[America’s strong economic growth this year surprises economists]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/04/26/americas-strong-economic-growth-this-year-surprises-economists]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_USP511.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-26T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 26th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIS YEAR America’s economy did not get the freshest of starts.

Volatility is so high, they say, that a buyer might as well place a wager at a casino. Others see a more direct cause for daily price movements of virtual money: changes in the supply of tokens. And when the company that makes those tokens is suspected of fraud, the casino itself trembles.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Rumours have long swirled about the bona fides of Tether, a four-year-old cryptocurrency with more than $2.8bn in circulation, and of Bitfinex, the exchange on which it is traded. On April 25th New York’s attorney-general, Letitia James, accused both of a cover-up intended to hide a $850m loss in client and corporate funds. Tether slid just 1.4% against the dollar on the news, but according to CoinMarketCap.com, a website, virtual currencies at large suffered more, with some $10bn wiped off their collective value within an hour of the attorney-general’s statement. Bitcoin, the most famous, fell from $5,499 for a single Bitcoin to a low of $4,953, before paring back some of the losses (though it remains choppy).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The shockwave is caused by Tether’s unique status. Its issuer, also called Tether, is the “central bank of the crypto world,” says David Gerard of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, a website that tracks the sector. Many cryptocurrency exchanges struggle to obtain bank accounts, because the market’s opacity makes it hard to keep tabs on flows of funds or to detect money-laundering. That makes lenders nervous. For those exchanges, Tether acts as a dollar substitute. Like fiat, as cryptocurrency buffs call government-issued money, it is pegged to hard currency, which is meant to insulate it from the worst of the volatility experienced by its anchorless peers. Traders use it as a common currency. Unhindered by regulation and the slowness of bank clearing, Tether flows quickly and easily between exchanges.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is not the only “stablecoin”, as cryptocurrencies designed to hold a steady price are called. But it is vastly dominant, representing 96% of daily trading volumes in that category. Some 80% of cryptocurrency trades ostensibly made in dollars are in fact executed in Tether. The currency’s wide acceptance is its strength—and a worry for everyone else. “For years, people have treated Tether as the biggest systemic risk in cryptocurrency,” says Mr Gerard. “Tether supplies most of the liquidity.” To justify its peg, Tether has repeatedly said that every coin issued is backed by a real dollar in a real bank account. But the company has provided no audit of these hard-currency holdings. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The allegations will provide doubters some relief—and more reasons to worry. Because Bitfinex was having trouble getting accounts at banks, the exchange operator used a Panamanian firm, Crypto Capital, as an intermediary to wire dollars to traders, Ms James says. She claims that last year Bitfinex entrusted over $1bn to Crypto Capital, “without any written contract or assurance”. When $850m of that went missing, Bitfinex sought to cover up the problem through “a series of conflicted corporate transactions”—giving itself access to up to $900m from a Tether account which the currency issuer had told investors “backed the tether virtual currency 1-to-1”. (Tether and Bitfinex share the same managers and owners).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In other words, the attorney-general concluded that the stash of cash supposed to back Tether did exist—but that it could easily be used for other purposes without customers knowing. Bitfinex has issued a statement saying that the attorney-general’s “court filings were written in bad faith and are riddled with false assertions”.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The accusations would have been much more severe just a few years ago. Now, however, they are likely to cause no more than “a short-term blip,” says Eric Turner of Messari, a data-provider that tracks cryptocurrencies. Some 30 stablecoins are under development, he notes, with a handful operational. Many submit to know-your-customer and money-laundering checks by national regulators. TrueUSD, another dollar-pegged stablecoin, holds collateral funds in an external trust; Eidoo, whose stablecoin is backed by gold, lets customers monitor the precious metal via webcam in the vaults where it is stored. Rivals’ “whole market proposition is that they are not Tether”, says Mr Gerard. Even as Tether fell after the allegations became public, peers such as TrueUSD and Paxos Standard jumped by about 2%, according to Messari’s index of stablecoins.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Investors will welcome more transparency. And tailwinds behind alternatives will have a positive side effect. Bitcoin prices closely track fresh issuance of Tether, which creates volatility and makes it easy to manipulate markets. The stablecoin pioneer’s fall from grace will probably make the cryptocurrency market more stable, not less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 04:11:32 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The genetic-data dystopia we may face]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/04/26/the-genetic-data-dystopia-we-may-face]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_OPP507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-26T17:14:23Z&quot;&gt;Apr 26th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE “SUBS” are, in effect, subhumans—people with a genetic rating at the low end of a 10-point scale. People tend to date others within their rate bracket. “Dealers” trade blood stolen from people with high ratings for those who need to dupe the tests. A commercial industry of self-help programmes exist for people to improve their rating, if only marginally. Individuals with famously high ratings are murdered by those protesting against “rate-ism”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The futuristic world depicted in “The Phlebotomist” is a disturbing one. A phlebotomist is someone who takes blood for medical tests.

As part of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future project, we asked Ms Road about the challenges of presenting genetics on stage and how she views the technology’s benefits and risks.

I worked at the Natural History Museum whilst training as an actor, and spent a lot of time pondering our place in the world. After graduating I became obsessed with researching genetics and altruism, trying to reconcile my politics with a biological world (and an industry) that seemed harsh, judgmental and competitive. I ended up writing this particular play largely because of a TEDx Talk I saw about pre-symptomatic genetic testing for cancer. The “would I want to know?” question fascinated me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until years later though, when a guy I was seeing decided to disclose that he was a carrier of a genetic disease “in case it affected our kids”—rather prematurely, age 23 and on our third date—that I saw the potential for a story. Relationships are so reliant on what we think we know about each other, the imaginary futures we create, and our subliminal expectations about what someone might deliver. I started to wonder how the availability of self-knowledge might exacerbate an “investment and return”-view of human life—and also open up the possibility of betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: The play delves deeply into the negatives of genetic technologies. What are the benefits that may appear alongside those negatives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Road&lt;/strong&gt;: The potential benefits of genomics are huge, from the relatively clear-cut pros of pre-emptive treatment and precision medicine, to the slightly murkier areas of genetic editing, athletic selection and forensics. Being able to treat and advise patients according to individual biological predispositions saves time and therefore lives, as well as money. While genetic editing in humans is not (supposed to be) happening yet, the benefits largely come in the form of choices, such as mastectomies for BRCA mutations or lifestyle changes for those at risk of diabetes type 2 or lung cancer. Ultimately all this preparation still doesn’t negate the fact that life is unpredictable—and the healthiest individual could get knocked dead by a falling coconut—but it certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have also flagged the benefits of the play’s new “genetic social order” because it does away with current hierarchies, but this view wrongly assumes that genetics and health exist in isolation from race and class. Certain diseases are more prominent within particular ethnic and economic groups, and environmental factors affect epigenetics. Living in an area of poor air quality, for example, can greatly impact one’s likelihood of developing a mutation for respiratory disease. People from lower income backgrounds are also less likely to have access to, or the time to implement, the nutrition and lifestyle changes necessary to manage their particular genomic potential. So the benefits are huge, but they’re not a fix-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: One seeming wrinkle in the play is that genetics was used to predict people’s potential diseases but not used to cure it—the other side of the coin, so to speak. Why didn’t you include that part of the technology’s promise as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Road&lt;/strong&gt;: I set out to explore a dramatic extreme of how this quest for knowledge might intersect with current social trends, and to generate a feeling of discomfort about certain aspects of contemporary culture, rather than to produce a balanced debate about genomics. Having said that, I do think the positive promises of the technology are implicit in the play. Characters monitor their personal “microbioms” and “fit-goals”, and discuss CRISPR Cas9 gene-editing trials for disease mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the play, simple gene edits are already available, but edits for complex conditions are still in trial. I also tried to situate genetic treatment within the economics of their world: the positive potential of genomics isn’t clear-cut in a struggling NHS. These days we barely have the infrastructure to treat the population for diseases they already have, let alone to pre-emptively treat every possible condition that a patient may one day develop. I imagined editing would be expensive and therefore exclusive. At the end of the day, money still talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: Having thought through a possible future so profoundly as a playwright, please now play the role of policymaker: what might be done to avert the dangers that you foresee?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Road&lt;/strong&gt;: I think we need clear laws protecting citizens’ right to genetic confidentiality. In America the GINA Act theoretically prevents genetic discrimination, but recent cases show significant loopholes. In Britain there is a voluntary moratorium on companies demanding genetic information as part of medical checks, but it’s due for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In genomics as in other areas, regulations around personal data struggle to keep pace with technological advancements. And the matter of confidentiality itself is not so black and white. One could argue (and companies do) that if a client withholds important information about their health, the imbalance of knowledge leaves the company vulnerable to exploitation. As genome mapping becomes more popular and laws become more necessary, I expect we’ll come up against resistance from insurance and mortgage providers who rely on a democracy of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist&lt;/strong&gt;: You used the emotional medium of the theatre to communicate important points about human dignity, freedom, equality and fairness in a way that is more effective than a nerdy essay. In an age of populism and growing authoritarianism, how would you make the case for democracy and liberalism so that it has impact? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Road&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s something about watching theatre that is in itself democratic; it requires the willing participation of both audience and company to create a performance community. In an increasingly atomised society, shared spaces and active experiences like this feel ever more important. Modern drama has been pretty successful in demonstrating the ills of populism and authoritarianism, but it is often limited to making us aware of the trap, rather than preventing us from falling into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our current climate, dramatising hope feels particularly necessary—and so perhaps we need to be a bit braver about exploring political empowerment on stage. In theatre our currency is the imagination; not only can we live out and learn from the worst-case scenarios, but we can also explore alternative realities without the fetters of realism. Maybe I need to get on and write some utopias…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*      *      *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_OPP505.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190427_OPP505.jpg 200w,

The scene involves two young women: Bea, who works as a phlebotomist (someone who draws blood for medical purposes), and an old friend, Char. The scene has been lightly edited from the original script.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scene 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phlebotomy consultation booth. Bea sits beside a screen. Char paces. She has just had a blood test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: How long?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Couple more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bea tidies away equipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Weird seeing you at work. Very professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Ha. Though, if you don’t mind I’m gonna have to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bea pulls out a lunchbox and sits down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Is that/?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Yep. Cheap and nutritious, why change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Char laughs, shakes her head. Bea eats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Sorry for taking up your... Thanks so much for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Was waiting for you to ask to be honest. You’re making the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s not really a ’decision’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Well you don’t technically have to/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah but not disclosing just looks worse doesn’t it. Like you have something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you looked at other firms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: They’re all asking, all the good ones anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Well it’s amazing you’ve got this far at all isn’t it? It’s massive. That degree counts for something eh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Char shrugs. Beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus the tension’s killing me! How do you stand this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: People normally wait outside, or come back next day. Stops it being so/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Horrendous? Sorry, sorry I’m being... I’m just feeling/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Come here. Look, whatever happens, I’m here for you OK? Whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bea checks. Still nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You still seeing whats-her-face? With the hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Who? Oh. Nah nah, that was just a bit of...you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She makes a face. Cackles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nah, think I’m getting a bit sick of ’em to be honest. Might go back to men. Simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Ha, don’t know about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: How is sexy Aaron? Sweet smelling and louche?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Ha. Yeah he’s great. We’re good. We’re er, well... it looks like we might move in together actually, so...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: What?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Fuckin hell Bea. That’s serious! Jeeeeeez! Well he is awwwwfully charming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device beeps. They both look at it. Bea gives Char a look, &amp;quot;Ready?&amp;quot;. Char nods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: No, hold on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She takes a breath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bea goes to the screen, clicks and sees the results load. She swallows and scrolls down. Char watches her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Um. Char.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t fuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: What is it? Please. Bea. Bea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: What is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s the Huntington’s. Everything else is fine, it’s just/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Fuck! Fuck. No, fuck! Oh fuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: God. Oh FUCK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pause.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How low is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Two, point…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Let me see?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bea shows Char the screen. Char tries to hold herself together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Look obviously this is just a number. We can look through the breakdown? And then I’ll book you in with a specialist to discuss what it means/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: It means I’m unemployable. I’m nothing. I can’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Your general risk for cancers and most diseases is actually really low, which is really lucky, it’s the/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Huntington’s. Incurable. Yeah, I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: But the overall/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t need the spiel Bea, I’m fucked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: How long have I got?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s speculative, I’m not supposed to/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah but everyone does, don’t they.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s just a rough /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I only take the blood, I don’t normally...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Char looks at her. Bea reluctantly consults the breakdown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Er...OK...er, well your predisposition to heart disease is also quite... but the Huntington’s will kick in...soonish...so at a guess, lifestyle depending, you’re probably looking at somewhere between 8 to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: But obviously you have to take that with a pinch of, well, there are so many variables/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Or you might get hit by a tram tomorrow! So you / Sorry/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Fuck / FUCK!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ll refer you to a genetic counsellor Char, this really isn’t my/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I have a degree. And a masters. I have worked my fucking arse off, it’s not fair!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: It’ll be alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: No it won’t, do you know what this means?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I know what Hungtington’s is, Char.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Dad stopped being able to walk/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I know/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Feed himself, hold things/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Stop it! Look. I’m gonna book you in with a counsellor. We need to start working out the best course of action for your disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t have a disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: No, not yet, but...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pause. Bea goes to her and hugs her. Silence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Can you delete the file please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: The results, the file, can you delete it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s no point, like you said, they’re all asking, not disclosing just looks worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Please, just/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Deleting it won’t change the result hun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: But if/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s no point!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: There is! Listen. Just bear with me yeah. I mean obviously I knew there was a fifty-fifty chance I’d have it, but I never wanted to know, did I. But then criteria started appearing so I started thinking about what I could do if... I started looking at how people get around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: If we used someone else’s blood, someone high, we could log it as me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: If we used someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: What are you asking me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: If there’s someone high you’ve tested, we could, could we test that again in/stead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Sshh! I could lose my job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve thought this through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Is that why you wanted me to do this? You said you needed moral support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I did, I do. But I also thought if/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s illegal Char. It’s fraud. I can’t! I’d lose my job. It’s a good job, I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you enjoying this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Having the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t be stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I can pay you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I can/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Dad left me a bit of/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Shut up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t want money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m fine, thank / you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: What are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: I know you’re struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Excuse me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re still paying off your mum’s loans right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m managing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Porridge for lunch, and you could do with a new pair of/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re blowing my mind right now, Char.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t fuck with me Bea, you used to take food from our fridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t bring that shit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Sorry. Sorry, I didn’t mean. I’m just... I really need this. I’ll do anything, honestly. Please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Look, I know how you/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: No you don’t! You’re not low rate!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: No, but/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: And Aaron, I bet he’s high too, right? What is he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: Well he’s...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: What is he? Some poor low rater? A little Charity case? No, what is he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: You know you can’t get into bar training unless you’re/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: So what is he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: 8.9, but/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: Wow/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: But we don’t care about ratings, we just met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Char&lt;/strong&gt;: But you’ve both got good blood. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pause.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next few years I’m going to begin the slow process of falling apart. I’ll disintegrate. I need this job so I don’t spend my last few years lying in a pool of my own/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bea&lt;/strong&gt;: OK! OK. OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long pause.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tested a 7.7 woman this morning. Propensity for diabetes, something else minor. Nothing scary. Is that about right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Char hugs her hard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give me a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bea exits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excerpted from “The Phlebotomist.” Copyright © 2018 by Ella Road.

In the first quarter of 2019 the company had a net profit of $3.6bn, up from $1.6bn in the same quarter last year. For over a decade Amazon has reinvested heavily in its business, at the cost of short-term earnings. The result is that despite its huge valuation it has delivered far less cumulative profit for its owners than any of the other tech superstars since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors may have hoped that the last few quarters marked the start of a new phase in the company’s life, when it will crank out huge sums of cash. In fact Amazon signalled the opposite, as it ramps up investment to roll out delivery capabilities for its Prime service. It is also investing heavily in AI and smart gadgets. As a result it expects to make earnings of $1.6bn in the second quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations of $4.2bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Amazon is not printing masses of money now, at least other tech firms are. Microsoft, which saw its market value rise to $1trn this week, made $8.8bn in net profits in the first quarter of 2019; Apple, which is expected to release its first-quarter results on Tuesday, made a profit of just under $20bn in the last quarter of 2018. The gap between Amazon and Silicon Valley’s other stars looks set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 02:06:56 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Suzanne Lacy’s moving public tableaux]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/04/26/suzanne-lacys-moving-public-tableaux]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_BKP508_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-26T17:39:23Z&quot;&gt;Apr 26th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN AN empty bull ring in Quito, Ecuador, man after man steps forward, his face sombre, to read a letter by an anonymous woman describing her experience of sexual violence. Captured on film, then projected onto large screens, each account fades in, then out. A bigger screen reveals the entire bull ring filled with hundreds more men reading the letters aloud. Candles flicker; music begins; in the stands above, still others quietly read terrible stories of abuse to one another. The effect is electrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is “De tu puño y letra (By Your Own Hand)” (pictured), an artwork by Suzanne Lacy, a renowned artist of “public practice”. It spanned months of workshops and collaboration, culminating with the Quito performance in 2015. It is now being reprised as part of a brilliant retrospective of Ms Lacy’s work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge of presenting collaborative, process-orientated artworks in museums has become more pressing as more artists turn to such forms of expression. With “Suzanne Lacy: We Are Here”, which spans nearly 50 years of work by this pioneer of dialogue-based artwork, SFMOMA and the Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts show how such pieces can be exhibited in a compelling way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps that Ms Lacy’s body of work, while rooted in social and political issues—feminism, race, media portrayals of youth, age, the working class—speaks powerfully in the language of art. From her first interventions highlighting rape in Los Angeles, to large international works that stage complex public conversations, she crafts powerful visual and polyphonic experiences for participants and viewers alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_BKP510_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190427_BKP510_0.jpg 200w,

In a performance called “Ablutions” (1972)—which Ms Chicago thinks was “probably the first public work of art about rape”—several women bathed in blood, eggs and clay, while another was wrapped in bandages. A soundtrack played women’s accounts of attacks and Ms Lacy nailed sheep kidneys to the wall. A bachelor’s degree in zoology inspired her to use animal entrails to biting effect, in parodies of Julia Child, an American television chef, and common romantic expressions. “Anatomy Lesson #2”, for example, is a series of photos of Ms Lacy draped in various body parts. One, where sheep lungs rest on her torso, is captioned: “‘You steal my breath away,’ she gasped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her shift towards what one curator calls a “more operatic style” came with larger works modelled on feminist consciousness-raising circles. By then, Ms Lacy says, she had grasped that “everything we do is an exchange—we don’t exist in the world individually”. Her most famous work from this period, “The Crystal Quilt” (1987), involved hundreds of older women coming together to talk about erasure and survival. They sat at coloured tables designed to look, from above, like a giant quilt; the performance, at a shopping centre in Minneapolis, was filmed and later broadcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While violence against women is an enduring theme of Ms Lacy’s work, in the 1990s she began a project addressing the demonisation of minority ethnic teenagers in Oakland, California, that would continue for a decade (pictured, above). This “lesson in social imagination”, as one critic called it, spawned eight major works aimed at giving teenagers their own voice. Adults are encouraged to “shut up and listen” as young people congregate on a rooftop, for example, or sit talking in their cars. The current exhibition carries this project forward with new work by young people addressing current problems through poetry, sound, media analysis and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_BKP509_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190427_BKP509_0.jpg 200w,

In the many communities with which Ms Lacy works, trust must be built over time, through “transparency and negotiation of difference.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of this approach is illustrated by a major project in Britain, “The Circle and the Square” (2017, pictured above). In the Lancashire borough of Pendle, an integrated community of millworkers—part Pakistani and Indian immigrants, part white British—fell apart when one of the country’s largest textile mills closed in 2007. Ms Lacy convened both groups in the abandoned factory, Asians in a circle performing Sufi chants and white residents singing in a traditional choral square. A stunning two-panel film beautifully blends music and image, overlapping and cross-fading to recreate the community that once existed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the aesthetic pleasure, the project produced concrete results. “She had a ridiculously large influence on the community as a whole,” reports Mark Thomas, the film-maker, including new arts grants and “a tremendous positivity that drew people out and together”. In this fractured political moment, he observes, “it’s vital to have this kind of practice now”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Suzanne Lacy: We Are Here” is on view at SFMOMA and the Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts until August 4th 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 01:06:19 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[As AI advances, what are humans for?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/26/as-ai-advances-what-are-humans-for]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_opp509.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-26T16:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 26th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WE ARE on the verge of turning off Alexa,” reveals Ian McEwan, a prizewinning British writer. “She [the voice-controlled smart speaker] keeps butting in on our conversations and I am rather suspicious of this listening device in the room. We might just pull the plug on her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wary relationship between humans and technology is also at the heart of Mr McEwan’s new novel, “Machines like Me” (reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/04/20/in-machines-like-me-ian-mcewan-asks-an-age-old-question&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From “Saturday in 2005”, set amid the protests in the run-up to the Iraq war to “Solar”, dealing with scientists and climate change, he regularly plunders worldly dilemmas for material around which to weave stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Mr McEwan has turned his hand to one of the most ethically contentious subjects of the day: the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and a potentially uneasy co-existence of real and synthetic humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with “The Economist Asks” podcast, he reflects on the moral quandaries of differentiating between synthetic and biological humans and his own on-off relationship with technology. “Anyone whose car has broken down and who gives it a good kick is already in an emotional relationship with a machine. Most of us know someone cleverer than us, so we’re quite well prepared to live among robots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author wanted his tale of an increasingly wilful android, set in the 1980s but with futuristic developments in mind, to reflect the debate about the risks and opportunities on machine learning. A couple—Charlie and Miranda—find themselves in a fraught &lt;em&gt;ménage à trois&lt;/em&gt; with their android, Adam. “They are in a delusion, like most modern parents who think they can shape the personalities of their children,” laughs Mr McEwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So would he acquire his own android to assist with the arduous process of researching and writing novels? “Absolutely. I would be very tempted and curious and that curiosity is deep in the culture,” he says. “Genesis is the story of making humans. Jason and the Argonauts has a robot called Talos. Frankenstein’s monster becomes a murderer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A machine-learning individual, he reckons, might even end up being more benign than humans. “We might have the joyful problem of rather nicer people among us. Suddenly we are not even the most intelligent thing on the planet!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What guidance would he have for young writers in the age of digital distraction? “They need to find at least an hour a day to be offline with a notebook and chisel out for themselves that precious commodity we are in danger of losing and which is so crucial to the life of the imagination—solitude.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//embed.acast.com/theeconomistasks/theeconomistasks-ianmcewan&quot; width=&quot;500&amp;amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;215&quot;  frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen on: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com&amp;amp;gt;Apple Podcasts | &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com https:=&quot;&quot; spotify=&quot;&quot; com=&quot;&quot; show=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYWNhc3QuY29tL3RoZWVjb25vbWlzdGFza3M&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=142125&amp;amp;amp;refid=stpr&quot;&gt;Stitcher&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://tunein.com/podcasts/Business--Economics-Podcasts/The-Economist-Asks-p999213/&quot;&gt;TuneIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listen to Kenneth Cukier on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/24/the-future-of-genetic-engineering&quot;&gt;Babbage podcast&lt;/a&gt; as he asks leading scientists, doctors and philosophers if ethics and regulations are able to keep up with the development of genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 01:06:18 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[On “Fleabag”, a Corbyn government and Kenneth Clarke’s tandoori moments]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2019/04/26/on-fleabag-a-corbyn-government-and-kenneth-clarkes-tandoori-moments]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_BRP507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-26T11:47:49Z&quot;&gt;Apr 26th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I FINALLY GOT round to watching a few episodes of “Fleabag” to see what all the fuss is about. A few good scenes, I thought, and a magnificently disgusting character with a beard, but apart from that underwhelming. The breaking of conventions (addressing the camera, graphic sexual references, sleeping with a priest) was tediously conventional; the sentimentality, particularly about a pet hamster, was cloying….“Fleabag” and the “Fleabag”-related hype is nevertheless interesting for sociological reasons: it demonstrates the annexation of yet another area of British life by the self-worshipping upper-middle classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comedy used to be a pretty working-class affair. In the Victorian and Edwardian era the upper-classes (including Edward VII) went to music halls to listen to working-class songs and jokes. Many of the giants of post-war comedy such as Eric Morecambe and Les Dawson (pictured, left) came from the northern working class, their talents honed in working-men’s clubs and local talent contests. The “Carry On” films traded in seaside-postcard smut while taking pot-shots at the pretensions of the British professional classes (“Carry On Doctor” is a masterpiece of doctor-deflation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fleabag” is to comedy what “Coldplay” is to music: a demonstration that yet another working-class redoubt has been thoroughly conquered by the professional classes. Fleabag’s parents live in a giant house with a garden-party sized garden. Her sister is a high-flying executive. Though she’s a bit of a drop-out, she’s a drop-out in the way that only very privileged people can be: she runs a (tediously wacky) café and turns up to work when she wants to. This is as it should be. People should write about what they know and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (pictured, right), the writer of the series, is a descendant of baronets and a product of Saint Augustine Priory, a posh Catholic school. But it is yet another example of British social closure as a tiny elite takes over ever more areas of British life and then congratulates itself on how magnificently rule-breaking they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popular explanation for this great social closure is that the fix-is-in: a tiny clique of hyper-connected metropolitan liberals have seized control of the machinery of cultural production and then throw a few baubles to selected minorities in order to persuade everybody (including themselves) that Britain is still an opportunity society. But I worry that the explanation may be darker: as the working class contracts and looses its cultural self-confidence, so working class institutions such as working men&amp;#x27;s clubs are dying.  The modern equivalents of Les Dawson or the Carry On Team don’t have anywhere to learn their craft while the Phoebe Waller-Bridges of this world drift from independent schools to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art convinced that they’re overturning social conventions and setting the world to rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE ARE finally beginning to take seriously the possibility of a government led by Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader. Mr Corbyn’s impressive performance in the last general election, in 2017, was largely written off as a protest vote: chunks of Remainer England voted for Mr Corbyn precisely because they thought that he had no hope of actually winning. Now with the Conservative Party determined to destroy itself, and Brexit-related turmoil mounting, people are getting seriously worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses are calculating exactly what a far-left government would mean and preparing to act accordingly. Foreign powers are beginning to think seriously about what they would do if Britain were run by a man whose basic foreign policy principle is “whatever America is for I’m against”. The Israelis are terrified about the prospects of a British prime minister who has supported Hamas, a militant Islamist group in Palestine, and indulged anti-Semites in his party’s ranks. I suspect that fear of a Corbyn-led government will soon become a major force in British politics—and not just a vague theoretical fear but a real and vivid fear. People will move. Money will flee. Foreign powers will prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE BRITISH political system is almost perfectly designed to make a hash of withdrawing from the European Union (EU). The system is an adversarial one: the governing party faces the opposition across a yawning divide and politicians bellow at each other. But leaving the EU demands a series of complicated compromises in the middle. The system is also designed to address a problem and move on to something else: each side states its position, parliament divides, and then you move on. But leaving the EU demands persistence above all: you have to keep worrying away at the same problem for week after week. It’s rather like using a hammer to chop down a tree. This structural problem is only going to get worse when (and if) parliament moves from the withdrawal agreement to the more laborious business of shaping our future trading relationship with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Clarke, who succeeds amazingly well in combining his twin roles as Tory grandee and regular bloke, recently gave a long interview to the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; in which he said that he repairs to the Kennington Tandoori every Tuesday evening on his own to enjoy a curry and read a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;. A colleague of mine found himself having dinner in that very Tandoori last Tuesday. Sure enough Mr Clarke was sitting there, on his own in a window seat, solidly working his way through his copy of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;. When he left his place was taken by Ann Widdecombe, a former colleague of Mr Clarke’s who has just quit the Tories to join Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. My colleague can’t be completely sure but he doesn’t think Ms Widdecombe was reading &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 22:06:17 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
