April 23rd marks the feast day of the region’s patron and coincides with the day both William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes are said to have died in 1616. Traditionally men give roses to women and women give books to men, though such distinctions are now frequently ignored. Street stands pop up in Barcelona and other Catalan cities, while authors meet with readers and sign books all day. As Carlos Zanon, a novelist, puts it, the day is “absolutely inclusive”. Jorge Carrión, whose English-language, non-fiction work “Bookshops” includes a chapter on Sant Jordi, says that “your readers come to you in person and explain why your books are important to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flowers allude to Sant Jordi’s legendary slaying of the dragon and liberation of a princess, which—according to local lore—took place in the Catalonian fortress town of Montblanc. In the spot where the dragon’s blood was spilt, a rose bush grew. The bookish side of the festivities has more recent, entrepreneurial roots. In 1931 publishers looking to boost sales merged an existing “day of the book” that took place each October with the “day of the roses”. The purported commemoration of Cervantes and Shakespeare now looks as much a clever marketing scheme as historical fact, with many contending that Cervantes died on April 22nd and still others pointing to conflations between the Gregorian and Julian calendars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has proved a compelling story nonetheless. Barcelona’s publishing houses are said to earn 5% to 8% of annual sales in a single day; new books are launched in March and April to capitalise on the event. In 2008 Carlos Ruiz Zafon sold 120,000 copies of his novel “El Juego del Ángel” (“The Angel’s Game”) in just 12 hours. Florists do even better, taking in 40% of the year’s income on Sant Jordi. One study found that rose prices peak at 8am, and then decline as demand and the quality of available flowers falls—ending the day at just one-sixth the price. A trade in second-hand roses picks up after lunch. No doubt, hearts are broken by dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event has been affected by shifting political tides. It took on added significance following the death of Francisco Franco, as the Spanish dictator had censored books and curbed use of the Catalan language. As &lt;em&gt;La Vanguardia&lt;/em&gt;, a daily newspaper, described the first post-Franco event in 1976: Barcelona “lived a different atmosphere yesterday. Different, absolutely, from the Sant Jordi of other years. There was a call to democracy. To freedoms.” Now, as the region bids for independence from the rest of Spain, Catalan-language literature has become ubiquitous at the street stalls, accounting for more than a third of the books sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995 UNESCO designated April 23rd World Book Day, but in Catalonia events maintain a local feel, with flags and banners emblazoned with Sant Jordi’s cross. The day is a celebration of love, literature and the love of literature. This year, as always, Ms Santos will use the same fountain pen to sign books for readers; the only thing that changes is the colour of the ink she uses. This year she has opted for deep red with a particularly appropriate name: “Dragon’s blood”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:06:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The risks to migrants of crossing the English Channel]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/04/23/the-risks-to-migrants-of-crossing-the-english-channel]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_blp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-23T12:19:18Z&quot;&gt;Apr 23rd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAND ON Britain’s southern shore, looking towards France, and your gaze will settle upon the world’s busiest shipping lane. Over 600 cargo ships pass through the English Channel each day. Many are heading to and from London or Rotterdam, separated by what amounts to a motorway-style central reservation that they may not cross (see image). Adding to the traffic are more than 60 daily cross-Channel ferry services, as well as fishermen and private recreation vessels that can number in the thousands on a summer weekend. To date, only small numbers of migrants have tried to reach Britain this way, but their numbers are rising: 539 migrants attempted the journey last year, according to figures from the Home Office, but around 80% of these attempts were made in the last three months of 2018. What are the risks and rewards of making the crossing? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks are clear: this is a testing crossing even for an experienced sailor with a seaworthy boat. It is not just maritime collisions that skippers have to think about. Tides in the Channel are among the biggest in the world. The island of Jersey has a maximum tidal range of over 12m (39ft). At low tide up to 3km of beach and rock can be exposed. The channel goes from 240km at its widest point to 33km at its narrowest, which is why tidal races such as the Alderney Race, a strait just off the Cotentin Peninsula of France, or the waters just off Portland Bill near Weymouth are so notorious. These can create treacherous seas even on the calmest of days. Then there are sandbanks, shoals, isolated rocks and other dangers to negotiate—and that’s before the weather plays its unpredictable part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet for migrants and traffickers this particular route also has a definite upside. Perhaps because of longstanding assumptions about the sea’s effectiveness as a barrier, there is little in the way of security controlling the movement of pleasure craft. Many hundreds of ports along Britain’s south coast can be entered by small boats, which are greeted by little more than a poster (see image) suggesting that a phone call to the authorities or the national yachtline may be required to declare the immigrant status of certain sailors. Official ports of entry such as Portsmouth or Southampton are for ferries and commercial traffic and a world away from an unmanned wooden jetty or marina berth where people come and go at all hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_blp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190427_blp502.jpg 200w,

The flying of the flag is still a requirement for ships coming to Britain from outside the EU (owing to concerns about disease more than migrants), but small boats do not always adhere to the rule. And a craft registered within the EU and wishing to enter another EU port need not show the Q flag at all, so there is no indication whether it has come from abroad or from just up the coast. On many occasions your correspondent has enjoyed a breezy daytime crossing, a berth in a French port, &lt;em&gt;steak frites&lt;/em&gt; on shore, and a jaunt back home the next day, with never a form filed or passport asked for. Britain’s Border Force has four cutters that are unlikely to patrol en masse in the Dover Strait. They may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:06:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Liberals need to ditch the technocratic for higher purpose]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/04/23/liberals-need-to-ditch-the-technocratic-for-higher-purpose]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_OPP501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-23T12:43:09Z&quot;&gt;Apr 23rd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE WORD liberalism is ambiguous. To some it evokes the generosity of the state; to others it suggests a surrender to the free market. Supporters see it as a way to guard free expression; critics consider it a means to allow noxious ideas. But this is hardly new: throughout its history, the term has meant different things to different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helena Rosenblatt, a historian of political thought at the City University of New York, has peered into its origins and evolution in her book, “The Lost History of Liberalism”. The concept flourished in France in the early 1800s to describe the emergence of individual rights, the rule of law and representative government. Only later was it adopted in Britain and America (and in the second half of the 20th century applied to left-of-centre politics in America).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s Open Future initiative, we are publishing an excerpt from Ms Rosenblatt’s book, on Adam Smith’s liberalism and colonial America. It is followed by a short interview with her about the need for liberals to ditch technocratic nerdery and once again embrace narrative, sentiment and higher purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*     &lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;*      *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Liberal Charters to Liberal Constitutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpt from “The Lost History of Liberalism: From Ancient Rome to the Twenty-First Century” by Helena Rosenblatt (Princeton University Press, 2018)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since medieval times, kings and emperors had granted charters conferring rights or privileges to towns, companies, or individuals. The sovereigns granting them, or the charters themselves, were called liberal when the rights they conferred were regarded as robust and, for example, involved generous economic concessions and considerable self­-government. When Englishmen left their homeland for the New World, they brought with them what they often called liberal charters establishing the colonies, and when tensions arose between England and America in the mid-­eighteenth century, much discussion revolved around whether the British government had the right to change the terms of these charters and impose new regulations and taxes on the colonies. Americans insisted that such impositions violated the charters as well as the protections accorded to them by the British constitution. They were no longer generous, not based on the principle of reciprocity; they were no longer liberal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in this highly politicized environment that Adam Smith published his famous book, &lt;em&gt;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; (1776). Today regarded as a foundational text of classical liberalism, it spoke directly to American concerns. Smith himself called it a “very violent attack...upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain.” Not only did he denounce English trade policies and advocate instead what he called a “liberal system of free exportation and free importation,” but he used the economy of North America to highlight the flaws of that of England. America illustrated the advantages of a system of natural liberty, in which the unimpeded investment in agriculture was causing rapid progress toward wealth and greatness. By contrast, Britain’s complicated and corrupt system of tariffs, bounties, monopolies, and other legal devices was just enriching the already wealthy while leaving the rest of the country impoverished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_OPP503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190413_OPP503.jpg 200w,

It was a word whose moral meaning every educated gentleman of his time would have understood. In book IV, chapter 9, Smith favored “allowing every man to pursue his own interest his own way &lt;em&gt;upon the liberal plan of equality, liberty and justice&lt;/em&gt;.” Smith’s “liberal plan,” his readers would immediately have recognized, was about not only freedom but also generosity and reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often forgotten that Smith’s first major and possibly most influential work was on ethics. In his &lt;em&gt;Theory of Moral Sentiments&lt;/em&gt; (1759), Smith wrote that “he is not a citizen who does not wish to promote, by every means in his power, the welfare of the whole society of his fellow-­citizens.” “The wise and virtuous man,” he continued, “is at all times willing that his own private interest should be sacrificed to the public interest of his own particular order or society. He is at all times willing, too, that the interest of this order or society should be sacrificed to the greater interest of the state or sovereignty of which it is only a subordinate part.” Moreover, Smith endorsed “liberality” as one of the cardinal virtues and the treatise contains a long discussion of gratitude and benevolence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liberal principles Smith advocated in the &lt;em&gt;Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; were “in the interest of the public,” while mercantile ones favored the “mean rapacity” of British merchants and manufacturers who, in league with the landowning aristocracy, con­spired against the public good. Smith defended free trade on the grounds that it would increase the welfare of “the lowest ranks of the people” and work “for the benefit of the poor and the indigent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Americans read the &lt;em&gt;Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; as a vindication of their policy of separation from England. Within a few months of its publication, the Continental Congress opened American ports to all foreign vessels and American calls for free trade grew louder. The new country’s very survival depended on it. Through the negotiation of new and liberal trade agreements with the nations of the world, Americans hoped for the advent of a new era of prosperity and peace. And on July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence by which the United States announced its secession from the British Empire and its reasons for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments, the Americans argued, derived their authority from the consent of the governed. They were instituted to secure the unalienable rights of men. Whenever a government became destructive toward those ends, it was the right of the people to resist and even overthrow it. Men, moreover, were created equal and possessed the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. All thirteen new states soon provided themselves with written constitutions establishing virtually the same principle: it was to secure the unalienable rights of men that governments were instituted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the concern for rights and their protections was not new in 1776. The British government itself recognized that it had granted charters conferring rights and privileges to the colonies. A major difference in the Declaration of Independence was that rights were now seen as natural, equal, and binding. They were no longer understood to be privileges granted by a liberal sovereign and thus subject to revocation by him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_OPP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190413_OPP506.jpg 200w,

By any measure, the United States was not a democracy in the eighteenth century. And, in any case, to most people at the time, “democracy” was synonymous with anarchy or mob rule. But neither did the United States recognize hereditary privilege. And thus it demanded that each &lt;em&gt;citizen&lt;/em&gt; display a “truly noble liberality of sentiment and affection,” a civic commitment by each individual “to embrace the good of all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____________________ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excerpted from “The Lost History of Liberalism: From Ancient Rome to the Twenty-First Century” by Helena Rosenblatt.

And if so, what factors achieve the opposite effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Rosenblatt:&lt;/strong&gt; Liberalism was born in a crisis that was both economic and political, namely the French Revolution. During the 19th century, however, economic and political crises also caused many to turn away from liberalism and toward socialism. In the 20th century, the Great Depression gave rise to the liberal New Deal. Today, downturns in certain sectors of the economy have attracted the electorate to populism. So, it is hard to generalise about the influence of social or economic trends on liberalism’s popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_OPP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190413_OPP504.jpg 200w,

History shows us that they are successful when they don’t just appeal to people’s economic needs and interests, but also to their sentiments, moral compasses and even certain needs of the soul. It seems that communicating a moral vision through inspiring leadership is more important today than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Liberalism prides itself on rationality to such a degree that it seems outside the emotive, narrative-driven part of people&amp;#x27;s decisions, attitudes and values. Little wonder it&amp;#x27;s on the back-foot as populists are on the march. Can liberalism embrace sentiment and story to compete without losing its soul of reason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Rosenblatt:&lt;/strong&gt; Of course! The majority of liberals in the past embraced sentiments at least as much as reason, and believed in values as much as they believed in policies and procedures. Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël, whom I argue are two of the real founders of “liberalism,” wrote copiously about emotions and feelings. Constant emphasised the importance of religious sentiments in any liberal society, while Madame de Staël wrote novels to cultivate the feelings she felt were needed to support and nurture a liberal political system, particularly generosity and compassion in her readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, both liberals believed in reason, science and enlightenment too. Sentiments and reason were not seen as antithetical to each other. It is only recently that liberals have lost touch with that crucial side of liberalism and become more policy-oriented, even technocratic in outlook. They speak of interests and choices more than values and obligations. I believe that people are craving for meaning and a higher purpose to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Why did France become the cradle of liberalism?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Rosenblatt:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of your readers will undoubtedly be surprised to hear that liberalism owes its origins to France. We are so used to taking for granted that liberalism is an age-old and venerable Anglo-American tradition. But if you follow the history of the actual word, as my book does, you learn that “liberalism” was coined and first theorised in France in the early 1810s as a result of the French Revolution. It stood for a cluster of principles that the more moderate revolutionaries were fighting for: the rule of law, civil equality, constitutional and representative government and a number of individual rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, evidence suggests that the word “liberalism” was invented as a term of abuse by its enemies and was originally meant to stigmatise these principles as a “religio-political heresy.” For most of the nineteenth century, liberalism was widely seen as a French doctrine and was closely associated with France’s successive revolutions (1789, 1830, 1848 and 1871). “Liberalism” remained a rare word in the language of English and American politics. It only gained currency in America’s political vocabulary in the early 20th century, and by then its meaning had been utterly transformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You note that liberalism originated in France in the 1800s but that the term &amp;quot;liberal&amp;quot; appeared earlier, notably by Adam Smith in the 1700s. How did the concept develop in Britain and France—and what was the interaction between the two places?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Rosenblatt:&lt;/strong&gt; The word “liberal” had been in use for centuries before “liberalism” was coined; but it was not a political or economic term. Instead it designated the ideal qualities of the member of a ruling elite. In Britain it referred to the virtues expected of a gentleman, in France those of a nobleman: magnanimity, generosity, devotion to freedom and the common good. Adam Smith used the word this way in his famous text, The Wealth of Nations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French Revolution, while giving birth to the word “liberalism,” also added a new and political meaning to the word “liberal”. In Britain, when the word meant something political, it was often rendered in italics, or with an “e” at the end to indicate its foreignness and dangerousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradually, both “liberal” and “liberalism” lost their revolutionary connotations. And with the advance of industrialisation, “liberalism” took on new meanings. It could now designate certain policies toward the economy, such as “new liberalism” and “classical liberalism,” the first favoring increased government intervention and the latter opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Why does it look like so many Americans are ready to discard it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms Rosenblatt:&lt;/strong&gt; The attraction of dictators grows in periods of uncertainty, such as the one we are living through today, when people are vulnerable to simple solutions. Charismatic leaders emerge who appeal to their emotions and often to their basest instincts. Many liberal politicians today have lost touch with people. They seem elitist, technocratic and aloof. We need leaders who can not only articulate good policies and laws, but who can also inspire people and morally uplift them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the paucity of good liberal leadership is only partly to blame. A huge problem, I believe, is our undervalued and thus underfunded public education system. Many voters today are woefully ignorant of their history and unschooled in the basic principles of citizenship. Moreover, there has been too much emphasis on vocational training and too little on the liberal arts and humanities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 19th-century liberals knew that the survival of liberal democracies required a politically-educated citizenry. As Alexis de Tocqueville said, it is necessary to “educate democracy.” And this, he said, was “the primary duty imposed on the leaders of society today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 22:06:33 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sri Lanka’s new threat, and more from our daily podcast]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/23/sri-lankas-new-threat-and-more-from-our-daily-podcast]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/the_intelligence_59.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-23T11:20:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 23rd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFTER CO-ORDINATED bomb attacks that killed hundreds, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/22/the-blame-game-begins-after-sri-lanka-bombings&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka is reeling&lt;/a&gt;.

A bitter political battle between the president, Maithripala Sirisena, and the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, had so crippled the government that it lacked the information to prevent the catastrophe, blamed on a little-known jihadist group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victims were mainly Christians who perished while attending Easter services in three churches in Colombo, nearby Negombo and Batticaloa on the east coast. At least 36 foreigners were among the dead in three other explosions at five-star hotels in Colombo. More than 500 people were injured in the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are very, very sorry as a government,” Rajitha Senaratne, its spokesman, said, before repeatedly claiming that Mr Sirisena had failed to give reports of a possible attack to Mr Wickremesinghe. Had he done so, it was implied, the carnage could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that national intelligence agencies had issued their warnings as early as April 4th. In a letter on April 9th the chief of national intelligence had even named suspects—a level of detail that is very rare for such warnings. And shortly before the attacks, the spy agencies’ foreign counterparts had again alerted Sri Lankan authorities that places of religious worship, especially of Catholics, and areas with high concentrations of tourists “may be targeted”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the local head of the Catholic church, said he would have cancelled all Easter masses had this crucial information been shared. The failure to communicate “makes us hold our heads in our hands”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was revealed that Mr Wickremesinghe has not even been invited to meetings of the national security council, which are chaired by the president, since October last year. That was when Mr Sirisena abruptly sacked the prime minister and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa, his predecessor as president, before dissolving parliament. But in December Mr Sirisena was humiliatingly forced to reinstate Mr Wickremesinghe as prime minister, after courts ruled the dissolution unconstitutional and illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large scale and co-ordinated nature of the bombings—with 87 more bomb detonators discovered at Colombo’s main bus station on Monday—point to a high degree of planning and considerable sophistication. The attacks are the first on such a scale since the end of the bloody 27-year civil war with the Tamil Tigers ten years ago, and the deadliest co-ordinated acts of terrorism Sri Lanka has ever suffered. They are the first directed at Sri Lanka’s Christian minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Senaratne blamed a local jihadist group called the National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) and said the suicide-bombers were Sri Lankan. But he also said the strikes could not have succeeded without an international network. Shiral Lakthilake, a spokesman for the president, separately told journalists that the “involvement of international elements is clear”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTJ is reported to have formed as a splinter of the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath (SLTJ) an ultra-conservative Islamist movement with ties to like-minded groups in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, a short distance across the sea. Radical Islamist networks, some fuelled by the rise of Islamic State, have also sprouted up in the broader region, from the Maldives to Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the carnage more than 1,000 police and soldiers were deployed for security in Colombo alone. A state of emergency covering the whole country is to go into effect at midnight on April 22nd. Mr Sirisena also appointed a three-member panel to investigate the “causes and circumstances of the tragedy” and declared April 23rd a day of national mourning. On Twitter Asanga Welikala, a law lecturer, described this gesture as “absolute rubbish tokenism”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also dismay at the way debate soon descended to political infighting. The attacks, however, have spurred an open discussion about the growth of jihadism in Sri Lanka. The conversation has been muted because of fears of stoking anti-Muslim sentiment. Extremist Buddhists from the Sinhala majority have on occasion attacked Muslims on various pretexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Muslim leaders have started speaking up. Rauff Hakeem, leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, a political party, said that Muslims and their leaders “have to engage in introspection regarding what is happening within the community”. He also said that community had been trying for a very long time, including through its mosques, to tackle the spread of extremism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 05:20:53 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[After terrorists kill nearly 300 people in Sri Lanka a blame game begins]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/22/after-terrorists-kill-nearly-300-people-in-sri-lanka-a-blame-game-begins]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/000_1fu2lg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-22T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 22nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE AFTERMATH of a co-ordinated series of terrorist suicide-bombings in churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday that left nearly 300 people dead, attention has begun to focus on the goverment’s failure to act on warnings that such an attack was imminent.

Pope Francis (pictured) duly chided rich countries over the arms race, called for peace in the greater Middle East and Africa, and lamented the victims of terror in Sri Lanka. The power of such occasions depends both on modern technology and on a centuries-old tradition, which holds that the task of representing Jesus Christ as his “vicar” on earth falls to a single, uniquely legitimate office-holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;But in the grounds of the Vatican, there are two gentlemen who use the title of pope: Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who lives nearby in a comfortable former convent. Officially, they get along well. On April 15th the current pontiff called on Benedict to offer congratulations on the eve of his 92nd birthday. But in photographs, Francis looked less genial than usual, and some wondered whether the wishes had been delivered through gritted teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;For several years, it has been clear that the relatively liberal, relatively inclusive style that Francis brings to the papacy is triggering a wave of theological and political opposition in many Catholic quarters. And some of that opposition is crystallising around Benedict, who styles himself “pope emeritus” and has retained some of the trappings of his old office, including the all-white garb plus a papal ring and dangling cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;What is not so clear is how far Benedict himself, and/or people with strong influence over him, are encouraging people to think of him as a counter-weight to Francis. But Massimo Faggioli, an Italian theologian, has likened the present situation to a “post-modern version” of a medieval schism: between 1378 and 1417, two and sometimes three clerics vied for the title of pope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Recent events have brought the contrast between the two clerics to a head. Benedict’s newly-published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/04/12/a-former-pope-blames-the-swinging-sixties-for-clerical-crimes&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the surging sex-abuse crisis on the swinging sixties and “homosexual cliques” in seminaries, was his most blatant intervention since stepping down in 2013. Francis showed a very different style when, in a TV show aired on April 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, he assured a gay British comedian that “only people who don’t have a heart” would fail to respect him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;For Vatican-watchers, all this simply marks one more episode in a long-term build-up of tension between the two popes, egged on by conservative critics of Francis. It was three years ago that Matteo Salvini, the anti-immigrant politician who is now Italian interior minister, sported a T-shirt with a pun in capital letters. “IL MIO PAPA E BENEDETTO” could either mean “my pope is Benedict” or “my pope is blessed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;On the ecclesiastical front, four conservative cardinals (of whom America’s Cardinal Raymond Burke was the best-known) showed their hand in November 2016 with a letter that challenged a Vatican document which had promised more generous treatment to Catholics who divorce and remarry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;A few months later, the Benedict camp seemed to offer moral support to that challenge. At the funeral of one of the four signatories, a German prelate who is one of Benedict’s close&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;aides, Georg Gänswein, read a letter from the ex-pontiff, saying pointedly that God would not abandon the church “even if the boat [is] on the verge of capsizing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Whereas traditionalist clerics take issue with Francis over reproduction and sexuality, worldly politicians find fault with him (and see merit in his predecessor) over questions like immigration and the protection of traditional Western culture. European conservatives loved Benedict for his perceived attachment to the heritage of their continent; their American counterparts resent Francis for his anti-capitalism and his embrace of the grievances of the global South. All these impulses have come together in the increasing prominence of a right-wing Catholic think-tank located not far from Rome, the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, with which Cardinal Burke and Steve Bannon, a former adviser of President Donald Trump, are deeply involved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;In the world of Catholic theology, as opposed to its political exploitation, there are those who insist that the Francis-Benedict rift is either exaggerated or being mischievously fanned by people who have little real concern for either cleric. Indeed, even among theologically-minded fans of Francis, some still profess admiration for Benedict “at his best” as a clear thinker and teacher. Michael Sean Winters, a Catholic writer, responded to the 6,000-word essay by calling it a mixture of flawed analysis and trivial anecdote which nonetheless contained glimmers of the “genius and beauty” which characterised the work of Benedict (formerly Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) at its finest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;And to right-wing Americans who loathe Francis’s aversion to capitalism and embrace of the environment, it can be pointed out that both Benedict and his predecessor John Paul II had some harsh things to say about the unrestrained market. Nor has any recent pope been a fan of America’s military policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;On the other hand, Benedict has hardly made life easy for his successor.&lt;span &gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After his surprise retirement in March 2013, he vowed to “remain hidden to the world”. He could have retired to a monastery in his native Bavaria and never said another public word. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Instead, he gave himself scope for future interventions. He not only kept many of the paraphernalia of office but, so critics argue, seemed keen to retain its essence. Many canon lawyers say his chosen title of “pope emeritus” is a dubiously-founded provocation, and that it would have been more correct to call himself bishop emeritus of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Others note that Benedict’s resignation speech, in Latin, was profoundly and perhaps deliberately ambiguous. He said that, because of his age, he no longer had strength to exercise the papal ministry (munus in Latin). But he then went on to say that the munus had aspects: one consisted of acting and speaking and the other of praying and suffering. Father Stefano Violi, a canon-law teacher, reckons that Benedict was merely surrendering the administrative duties of a pope but not the pastoral ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;For conservatives who want to present themselves as anti-Francis but loyal (perhaps more loyal than the pontiff himself) to the Catholic tradition, Benedict’s presence in the Vatican city is, at a minimum, a golden opportunity.&lt;span &gt; And Benedict seems unable to resist the temptation of offering that opportunity.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 00:06:23 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[American millennials think they will be rich]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/22/american-millennials-think-they-will-be-rich]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/20190427_woc760.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-22T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 22nd 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE THAN half of American millennials, the generation of people born between 1981 and 1996, believe that they will one day be millionaires; one in five think they will get there by the age of 40. These are the findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://s1.q4cdn.com/959385532/files/doc_downloads/research/2018/Millennials-and-Money-survey.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2018 by TD Ameritrade, a financial-services company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Will-Retirement-Saving-Change-by-2050.docx.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;working paper&lt;/a&gt; by the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, offers a sobering antidote to this youthful optimism. It finds that millennials are less wealthy than people of a similar age were in any year from 1989 to 2007. The economic crisis of 2008-09 hit millennials particularly hard. Median household wealth in 2016 for 20- to 35-year-olds was about 25% lower than it was for the similar-aged cohort in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American millennials are comparatively poor because many of them came of age during the financial crisis, when demand for labour was low and borrowing money became harder. The recovery has been slow, which has further reduced millennials’ long-term earning potential. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018080pap.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by the Federal Reserve, published last year, found that millennial household incomes were 11% lower than they were for people in Generation X (those born between the mid-1960s and 1981) at a comparable age; they were 14% lower than for baby boomers at the same point in their lives. A growing number of young people have taken on debt to finance their studies. And because real wages have not kept up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt;, the cost of living has risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190427_WOC757.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190427_WOC757.png 200w,

Millennials do more freelance and part-time work than other generations did, which makes it more difficult to obtain an employer-provided pension. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nirsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Millennials-Report-1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Only 55%&lt;/a&gt; of this generation have access to retirement plans, compared with 77% of Generation X and 80% of baby-boomers. Moreover, those who do have employer pensions are more likely to have defined-contribution pensions than defined-benefit ones, meaning that they bear the risk if investment returns disappoint. And as America seeks to plug its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/02/08/americas-extraordinary-economic-gamble&quot;&gt;long-term fiscal shortfalls&lt;/a&gt;, millennials will have to bear the burden of any future cuts to Social Security and Medicare. All of this helps to explain why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/05/its-becoming-more-common-for-young-adults-to-live-at-home-and-for-longer-stretches/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; of people aged 25 to 34 who are living with their parents has increased from 10% in 2000 to about 15% today. That is not quite the high life millennials imagined.&lt;p&gt;But all is not lost. Millennials are living longer and are the best-educated generation in history. Taken together, this could yet mean that the youngest millennials, who have been less scarred by the crisis, could contribute towards their retirement pots for longer. Then there is mum and dad: even if they don’t become millionaires, millennials will one day inherit from their parents, and that may help redress their relative poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 22:07:27 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Airlines may be underestimating the cost of the 737 MAX groundings]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2019/04/18/airlines-may-be-underestimating-the-cost-of-the-737-max-groundings]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/000_1f706b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-18T10:58:39Z&quot;&gt;Apr 18th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;IN MARCH REGULATORS around the world grounded all Boeing 737 MAX jets after two of the type crashed within five months of each other, killing 346 people. Soon afterwards Ryanair, the carrier in Europe that has placed the most orders for the new jet, insisted that the move would have little impact on its network. That was either wishful thinking or misinformation. Just three weeks later, the number of flights it had scheduled from London to Edinburgh, Britain’s busiest domestic route, fell 85%. Frequencies from London to Belfast plummeted 91%. If flights had to be axed, those ones made the most sense. Margins are tight on these routes due to high domestic aviation taxes in Britain and stiff competition from other airlines and rail firms. But the move highlights the growing toll that the MAX’s grounding is having on airlines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Across the Atlantic, 275 flights per day are now being cancelled by American and Southwest, the two airlines that operate the most MAXs in America. Both carriers hope to resume normal service in August, by which time Boeing hopes to have fixed the software bug that is suspected to have caused the two crashes. But the timeline is mere guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Even if accurate, it could take Boeing much longer to get the fix approved by regulators in other countries. In previous years, the quality of the regulatory processes at the Federal Aviation Administration, America’s aviation regulator, was so respected that other countries deferred to its judgement in reciprocal arrangements. But now officials in Europe and Canada want to conduct their own tests before letting the MAX back in their skies. They were dismayed and alarmed by the reluctance of the FAA to ground the jet after the second crash in Ethiopia. Some suspect that Boeing’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/business/2019/03/23/regulatory-capture-may-be-responsible-for-boeings-recent-problems&quot;&gt;cosy relationship&lt;/a&gt; with its regulator may have skewed its judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;Despite these difficulties, Boeing’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/gulliver/2019/04/07/why-boeings-shares-have-not-fallen-further-after-the-737-max-crashes&quot;&gt;share price&lt;/a&gt; is up just under a fifth since the start of the year. Investors think airlines will stand by their MAX orders given that Airbus, Boeing’s European competitor, has no spare capacity to produce more of its rival A320neo jet. But Boeing has already slowed the rate at which it assembles MAXs, down from 52 to 42 aircraft per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;In any case, its 5,000-strong orderbook for MAX jets looks vulnerable. Garuda, an Indonesian carrier, is cancelling its 49 orders. Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines—the two carriers that have lost MAX aircraft—are unlikely to honour their 212 orders. Other big operators might use the grounding as an excuse for trimming commitments. Even airlines loyal to the manufacturer will hit Boeing with hefty compensation bills for the extra costs that they have incurred since the planes were grounded. And the relatives of the 346 dead are likely to sue the aircraft manufacturer in great numbers as well. Boeing will not be ruined by this crisis. But nor will it emerge unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 19:07:38 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
