Leading the charge was Aaron Peskin, a member of the city&amp;#x27;s Board of Supervisors, the legislative body. In January, when he introduced the measure, he said he had “yet to be persuaded that there is any beneficial use of this technology that outweighs the potential for government actors to use it for coercive and oppressive ends.” That argument proved compelling. Just one of the city’s nine supervisors opposed the ban (though she acknowledged it was “a well-intended piece of legislation”) and the mayor will probably soon sign it into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure does not ban private citizens or businesses from using facial=recognition technology, or from sharing with police what any facial-recognition enabled cameras gather, subject to board approval. Taylor Swift used the technology to identify stalkers; stadiums have used it to identify banned fans and people transmitting data to bookies. Both of those uses remain legal in San Francisco. The bill does not prevent the technology’s use at airports and ports, which are federally regulated. Nor will anyone who is already using it have to stop: San Francisco’s police department has not deployed it. The ban is designed not to stop abuses, but to prevent them, and to ensure that citizens have a voice in how they are watched and policed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential for abuse is vast. Technology such as facial-recognition cameras and automatic licence-plate readers can gather images constantly and store them indefinitely. They make surveillance cheap and invisible. Compiling a record of, say, everyone who walks or drives past a given intersection over the course of a day no longer requires teams of police officers to stand on the corner noting what they see. That type of surveillance costs money and manpower, and lets people see that they are being seen. Cameras atop light-posts are effectively invisible (generally, people only see them when they look for them), always on and feed images into a searchable database where they can reside forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may shrug, believing that since their phones already track them, and their social-media accounts provide a record of their preferences, travel, and in many cases political beliefs, one more incursion on their privacy does not amount to much. But facial-recognition technology is rather different. A person can choose to leave their phone at home, or delete their social-media accounts. To avoid being tracked in a city blanketed with facial-recognition cameras, they would have to stay home. As pro-police as most Americans are, most would probably prefer to be able to cross the street without the government knowing exactly where and when they did so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this type of technology really imperils is the space for disobedience built into any humane system of laws. It narrows—and makes possible it possible to eliminate—a tension: on one hand, people want laws to be enforced consistently and impartially, as they should. But they also do not want to be fined every time they jaywalk or exceed the speed limit. Anyone inclined to scoff at the notion of governments enforcing all the laws all of the time should bear in mind how local governments&amp;#x27; budgets depend on fines and fees from on their citizens. That sort of enforcement may not happen tomorrow, but facial-recognition enabled cameras make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America is not yet at that point. Facial-recognition is not currently widely used. It is reported not to work especially well in non-controlled settings—it cannot always compare and identify people at odd angles, in motion and under bad lighting. It grows less accurate as a database gets larger, and it is especially bad at accurately identifying non-white people. But it is getting better and more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most places are neither as tech-savvy nor as liberal as San Francisco and they may not support an outright ban. But other places should take a hard look at the other mandate enacted by San Francisco’s legislation. It requires city agencies to obtain approval from the city’s board of supervisors before they buy any surveillance technology, to write policies governing its use and to report annually on how often and why they used it. It does not bar agencies from obtaining the technology they deem appropriate; it just prevents them from doing so in secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of oversight should be routine. But it is rare. Just nine cities (and one county) have similar ordinances on the books, with roughly another two dozen cities and states considering them. Banning technology that the police want might be a step too far for some cities. But ensuring that those empowered to kill and arrest in the community’s name must be accountable to the community is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 08:24:48 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alexis Tsipras sails into a social media storm in Greece]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/05/16/alexis-tsipras-sails-into-a-social-media-storm-in-greece]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190518_eup503_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-16T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 16th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ALEXIS TSIPRAS has been talking up his left-wing credentials as he campaigns for the European parliament election on May 26th, which is widely seen as a test run for a Greek general election due by late October. In speeches, the prime minister makes a point of distancing the ruling Syriza party from the corrupt, high-living elite he blames for plunging the country into an unprecedented eight-year recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last week, though, Mr Tsipras took a roasting on social media: photos of him lounging on an Athens tycoon’s yacht last August appeared on scores of Greek websites. The premier’s unannounced holiday was also criticised as disrespectful to the memory of 102 people who had been killed in a devastating forest fire the previous month. Many of the deaths could have been prevented, investigators argued, were it not for bungling by the police and the fire service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some Syriza aides worry that Mr Tsipras is losing touch with voters. He recently spent a week on a leisurely campaign tour on Crete with Pavlos Polakis, the outspoken deputy health minister. Many Greeks were shocked when Mr Polakis blasted a young, wheelchair-bound psychiatrist, a European parliament candidate with the opposition New Democracy party, for using procedures intended for people with special needs to get a job at a state hospital. He ignored calls to apologise from  cabinet colleagues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr Tsipras shrugged off the incident, calling Mr Polakis “a blunt-spoken islander”. When Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of New Democracy, demanded a parliamentary vote to censure him, the prime minister raised the stakes by calling for a vote of confidence in his minority Syriza government.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Syriza survived that vote  thanks to backing from right-wing and independent MPs. It helped, too, that Mr Tsipras announced a pre-election economic package worth around €1bn ($1.1bn) during the confidence debate, to be delivered before May 26th. A one-off payment to pensioners will cost €800m, while a huge cut of 11 percentage points in value added tax, from 24% to 13%, on food and drink served in cafes and restaurants will reduce revenues by an estimated €600m. Mr Tsipras has already postponed a commitment to Greece’s creditors, the EU and the International Monetary Fund, to lower the income-tax threshold. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Syriza is still trailing New Democracy by a wide margin, according to opinion polls. But two polls published last week showed the gap shrinking from 8-9 points to 6-7 points. Voters are unfazed by Mr Tsipras’ choice of holiday companions, it seems, if he comes up with tax breaks and generous handout.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 08:24:47 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[An artist revisits famous images from the Kosovo war]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/05/16/an-artist-revisits-famous-images-from-the-kosovo-war]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190518_BKP510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-16T15:48:13Z&quot;&gt;May 16th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A MAN looks beyond the camera, his eyes imploring and filled with tears. He holds up his wallet, showing two passport-sized photographs of young children—they are standing against a standard studio background and smiling. The man has been recently moved from a prison where he was brutally tortured; his face is red, evidence of the boiling water that has been thrown on him. It is a tragic image, taken in 1999 by Peter Turnley, a photojournalist who was documenting the Kosovo war. An estimated 13,500 people were killed or went missing during the conflict, which lasted from February 1998 to June 1999; it is thought to have caused &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446925/&quot;&gt;one of the largest population displacements in Europe since the second world war&lt;/a&gt;. Photographs such as this one communicated the personal suffering behind the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking the 20th anniversary of the end of the war, Alban Muja, a Kosovan artist, has made three of these images the starting point of an installation at the Venice Biennale. In three films, entitled “Family Album”, he interviews four child refugees, now adults, who were the subject of the photos. Lit against a dark background, the participants discuss their flight from Kosovo, the moment the photo was taken and the impact that its dissemination had on their families. “We asked them to describe the image, but through the image, they talk about what their family experienced,” Mr Muja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get our daily newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor&amp;#x27;s Picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; required=&quot;&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email address&quot;  aria-label=&quot;Subscription mail&quot;/&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Sign up now&quot; /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/prospero/20190518_bkp509.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/prospero/20190518_bkp509.jpg 200w,

Agim, at two years old, was pictured being passed through a barbed wire fence in a photo taken by Carol Guzy, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist. He explains that he was uninterested in the image as a child—although his parents talked about it constantly—but was surprised to see it printed on a billboard. Whether they liked it or not, these children’s faces became part of history and of their country’s self-conception after independence was declared in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This formed part of the impetus for “Family Album”: Mr Muja wanted to offer these individuals some agency. Besa was pictured swaddled in blankets and breastfeeding from her mother at only six months old, a long line of refugees snaking out behind them. Besim and Jehona, the two children separated from their father (they reunited with him in Mitrovica after the war), discovered that the photograph was being given away as part of a NATO-themed collectible series from a chewing-gum brand. “Our idea was to focus totally on their story, to give the attention completely to them,” Mr Muja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/prospero/20190518_bkp507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/prospero/20190518_bkp507.jpg 200w,

It was a photo in the family album (pictured) that sparked his interest in this project to begin with: a snapshot of Mr Muja with José María Aznar, the Spanish prime minister at the time, who was visiting the camp. “When I was nominated for the [Kosovan] pavilion, I was sure I was going to start from that image,” he says. “But I thought it would be much more important if I were to go beyond that, not only telling my personal story, but to research other images.”&lt;p&gt;This strategy is particularly notable at this year’s Biennale, where Christian Büchel, a Swiss-Icelandic artist, has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/arts/design/migrant-boat-venice-biennale-christian-buchel.html&quot;&gt;making headlines&lt;/a&gt; with his installation in a former shipyards. “Barca Nostra” exhibits the remains of a fishing vessel that capsized in 2015, killing hundreds of migrants who had packed into its hull. However, monumental and soulless, Mr Büchel’s work does little to help a privileged Western audience reconsider the struggles of migrants. Mr Muja’s work, by contrast, rejects spectacle in favour of refugees’ voices. It forces the viewer to consider how the images shown in the news affect those who are portrayed in them. “The idea was not just to talk about only the Kosovo war, to address something that is happening even now as well,” Mr Muja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Family Album” continues at the Republic of Kosovo Pavilion at the Venice Biennale until November 24th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 23:43:07 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Democracy is floundering: we need to fix it or lose it]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/05/16/democracy-is-floundering-we-need-to-fix-it-or-lose-it]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190518_OPP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-16T12:47:45Z&quot;&gt;May 16th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE WORLD may turn bleak without good governance. “A new dark age could descend in some regions where tyrants abuse their subjects and where jihadists or criminal gangs roam freely to terrorise dispossessed populations.” Or so say Nathan Gardels and Nicolas Berggruen in “Renovating Democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is a romp through all that’s going wrong with politics, from populists on the rise, robots stealing jobs, climate change being ignored and technocrats bereft of fresh ideas. Helpfully, the pair focus on solutions, from “universal basic capital” (financial support from the state so people invest) to finding common ground between China and America to ensure stability. Without this accord, they foresee “swaths of pandemonium” that “surround gated outposts that are linked to one another but [are] divorced from their planetary hinterland in a kind of global apartheid system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s sobering stuff, and from an unlikely source. Mr Berggruen is a billionaire investor who has parlayed his wealth into a foundation, the Berggruen Institute, that supports good governance and big ideas. Mr Gardels is a co-founder of the institute and the editor of its media offshoot, The WorldPost. The Economist’s Open Future initiative questioned the authors in a short interview. It is followed by an excerpt from the book, on relations between China and America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *   &lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;*   &lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist: You argue that we need to &amp;quot;renovate democracy.&amp;quot; But another way to see things is that democracy is working just fine, it’s just that the outcomes don&amp;#x27;t appeal to comfortable cosmopolitans...

But democracy is as much about what happens outside the ballot box: impartial rules, practices, institutions—and political culture—that are not only inclusive, but that foster the reasoned discourse, negotiation and compromise necessary to reach a governing consensus in diverse societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent decades this system has decayed. The mainstream political parties were captured by the organised special interests of an insider establishment that failed to address the dislocations of globalisation and disruptions of rapid technological change. This led to a deep distrust of governing institutions by all those left behind. Such disaffection gained more traction than ever before because of the participatory power of social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an unresponsive elite forsakes the average citizen in a system legitimated by popular sovereignty—and fortified by social media—demagogues who fashion themselves as tribunes of the people ride the rage to power. Thus the Brexiteers and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger now is that the fevered populists are throwing the baby out with the bathwater, assaulting the very norms and institutional checks and balances that guarantee the enduring survival of republics. The revolt against a moribund political class has transmuted into a revolt against governance itself. The result is protracted polarisation and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief challenge now is not for partisans to put their teams back in power through elections, but to mend the breach of distrust between the institutions of self-government and the public. This can be done by integrating social networks and more direct democracy into the system. It needs to be “mediated” by new, deliberative practices that complement representative government and compensate for its waning legitimacy. In our book we call this “participation without populism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take but one example, if such a platform for citizen’s deliberation linked to a public vote had been in place before the Brexit referendum, all the consequences we now know would have been aired and the outcome would have been different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messrs Gardels and Berggruen: The point here is that, as digital capitalism divorces employment and income from productivity growth and wealth creation, making a living through gainful work will diminish. The best way to address inequality then is to spread the equity around by fostering an ownership share by all in companies where productivity growth is driven by intelligent machines that displace jobs. The aim is to enhance the skills and assets of the less well off in the first place—that is, “pre-distribution”—instead of only redistributing the wealth of others after the fact. We call this universal basic capital in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist: Among your solutions to the problems of wealth inequality is a scheme for people to own an equity stake in the robots that will run tomorrow&amp;#x27;s economy. How would that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messrs Gardels and Berggruen:&lt;/strong&gt; The point here is that, as digital capitalism divorces employment and income from productivity growth and wealth creation, making a living through gainful work will diminish. The best way to address inequality then is to spread the equity around by fostering an ownership share by all in companies where productivity growth is driven by intelligent machines that displace jobs. The aim is to enhance the skills and assets of the less well off in the first place—that is, “pre-distribution”—instead of only redistributing the wealth of others after the fact. We call this universal basic capital in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be done in a conventional way through savings accounts in which all participate who are invested in mutual-fund-type instruments. “Platform cooperatives” are another way: for example, everyone in a neighborhood could own a piece of ride-sharing services that operate there, or those who share their personal medical data would get a royalty payment from pharmaceutical inventions based on that data. The public could be assigned equity shares of any IPO by companies that benefited from publicly funded R&amp;amp;D. Another way, as California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed, is a “data dividend” for the use of your personal data by big tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he Economist: You call for a pact between America and China to ensure global order. What is the role of Europe in this world? Will Africa and Latin America need to &amp;quot;choose sides,&amp;quot; so to speak?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messrs Gardels and Berggruen:&lt;/strong&gt; The return of China to centre stage, not least through its Belt and Road initiative that will revitalise Eurasia, shifts the centre of gravity of the world order eastward. To maintain a civilisational presence in this new constellation, the bond between America and Europe is more important than ever. In a way, China’s rise forges a new common identity for the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, within this common identity, Europe’s social model can soften the harsher edges of America’s free-for-all market mentality. For example, it has already done so on digital privacy and leading the way on “flexicurity” policies, as some Nordic nations have, that protect workers instead of jobs through universal social benefits not linked to employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If things are left to float as they presently are, Latin America, and Africa in particular, will have to choose. But there is an alternative. Instead of flatly rejecting China’s Belt and Road project like Stalin did the Marshall Plan, the West could join it and thereby ensure more transparency and debt sustainability. Further, Europe in particular, could complement China’s hard infrastructure investments in Africa with soft-infrastructure investment in health, education and good governance. This would not only mitigate the need to choose sides, but also stem the growing flow of migration northward from the Africa continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist: You write: &amp;quot;A new dark age could descend in some regions where tyrants abuse their subjects and where jihadists or criminal gangs roam freely to terrorize dispossessed populations.&amp;quot; The alternative is a strongman to restore order. How can we realistically find a democratic solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messrs Gardels and Berggruen:&lt;/strong&gt; Such forces arise when there is a vacuum of power and authority. The refugee and immigration crisis emanating from Central America, for example, is not the result of strong states persecuting their citizens, but of weak states that can’t protect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this respect, the Western military interventions and misguided attempts to “nation-build” other’s nations, for example in Libya and Iraq, have worsened the situation. ISIS arose in such a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill the vacuum, first comes security, the rule of law, sound governance and development. Then comes democracy, which can only organically emerge out of those conditions. Change will only take hold if made by those who own it. To put the cart of democracy defined by the pro-forma exercise of elections before the horse does not work. It inevitably deepens the divisions in society instead of repairing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Economist: Many problems you identify are about managing pluralism. The world is pressed together like never before, and perhaps we&amp;#x27;ve globalised quicker than our mindsets could adapt. Is there a solution to the tribalism, which is influencing our politics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messrs Gardels and Berggruen:&lt;/strong&gt; It is no surprise that those left behind by the enormous and rapid changes of recent years are seized by anxiety and the sense they’ve lost control over their destiny to distant institutions run by strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While economic globalisation and technology have moved the world toward convergence of unprecedented scope and at a swift clip, the cultural and political imagination engenders the opposite. It creates a search for shelter within the familiar ways of life, that register a dignity of recognition among one’s own kind and constitute identity against the swell of seemingly anonymous forces.  When people retreat into their own suffering, better angels lose their wings. Then politics becomes tribal: us versus them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tribalism will only diminish to the extent the excluded recover a meaningful role in owning their future. Above all, that means renovating the practices and institutions of democratic deliberation so they are genuinely inclusive instead of captured by organised, special interests or demagogues who play on emotions without delivering the goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *   &lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;*   &lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190518_opp502.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/images/2019/05/blogs/open-future/20190518_opp502.jpg 200w,

A new modus vivendi that accepts this reality must be found among different cultures and civilizations now tied together as never before in a web of mutual dependence—a web in which the weight of the global economy has shifted from the once-regnant developed world to the emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this evolution to unfold with a modicum of stability, the success or failure of diverse models of governance that arise out of plural civilizational and cultural contexts must rest on competition over results, not on the dogma of a dominant ideology, interference by others, or imposition by force—in short, a global system of “diverse equilibrium” in which the power of example, not the example of power, prevails. That is what globalization in which “one size does not fit all” will look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, Donald Trump’s “America First” posture may turn out to be the midwife of such a new equilibrium. By rejecting the Paris Climate Accord, pulling out of trade agreements, parting ways with the United States’ European allies, and shirking the country’s long-standing liberal internationalism, he is paving the way for an alternative order in which the United States as a nation-state is no longer the dominant player. By default, those who move in to fill the vacuum will determine the new balance of power. By withdrawing from a leadership role in shaping globalization, the United States doesn’t stop the process; it only opens the path for the rise of new players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On climate change, for example, we have already seen in response the emergence of a “network of the willing”—ranging from China and the European Union to subnational entities like the state of California—to carry on global cooperation. Through California Governor Jerry Brown’s leadership before he left office earlier this year, 188 subnational entities in 39 countries on 6 continents are pushing ahead to implement the Paris Climate Accord despite its abandonment by official Washington. Former World Trade Organization chief Pascal Lamy even talks of a “plurilateral” world order of nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and subnational entities instead of a “multilateral” order based on nation-states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all nations and networks must have their respected place in any globally inclusive arrangement, in the end the key pillars of such an order, in which the management of convergent interests is bound by commonly agreed rules, must be the United States and China—the world’s two largest economies, which also represent highly distinct civilizational spheres. For globalization to work, it needs leadership. Yet, as the late Zbigniew Brzezinski pointed out, neither the United States nor China can lead on its own. American power has diminished, and China is not yet ready or able to step up to the plate, and may never be prepared to take on the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If both fail to buy in as indispensable partners, such an order can’t take hold globally. The urgent concern is that these two giants are headed in opposite directions. As former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd has eloquently put it, “In the absence of a common narrative shared by the United States and China, the two nations are likely to drift more rapidly apart. Trust builds on itself just as distrust builds on itself as well, compounding into deep enmity over time.” Time is short, and distrust is building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alternative to a world order anchored in a partnership of its two most influential nations looks grim. Alongside the new networks of the willing, swaths of pandemonium fostered by the unwilling will likely then surround gated outposts that are linked to one another but divorced from their planetary hinterland in a kind of global apartheid system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new dark age could descend in some regions where tyrants abuse their subjects and where jihadists or criminal gangs roam freely to terrorize dispossessed populations. That so much of this sounds familiar—the brutal carnage of the Syrian civil war being the most tragic case in point—is a frightening indication of just how real the peril is. And, as we have further seen in the enduring refugee crisis and wave of mass migration, those who can flee will seek to breach the gates in search of a better life on the other side. In many ways, this is the price of leaderless globalization left to its own dynamics without effective cooperation or governing institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the height of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015, Antonio Guterres, then the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and now the UN secretary general, warned that such a world was already in the making: “We live in a period in which we no longer have a unipolar or bipolar world. We don’t even have a multipolar world; it’s kind of a chaotic world where power relations have become unclear. When power relations are unclear, impunity and unpredictability tend to prosper. That, I believe, is the reality behind the high levels of displacement that are taking place in today’s world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But partnership between the United States and China is far easier said than done. Unlike the transatlantic order now receding, which was bound together at its core by common cultural and political foundations, the United States and China come from very different civilizational roots. The Middle Kingdom has historically defined itself by its centrality and uniqueness in the world going back millennia; the United States’ comparatively young identity is associated with universality and the mission of spreading its values. China’s geopolitical model has always been that of a dominant power surrounded by tributaries. By contrast, the United States, following the experience of Europe after the Treaty of Westphalia gave birth to the nation-state, has managed its international relations by seeking a global balance of power among states. A “cross-civilizational” partnership between these two traditions is unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to China’s role in its own region, Henry Kissinger’s formula is the most realistic arrangement for the next twenty years. “It’s understandable that China wants to keep foreigners from approaching its borders and it therefore undertakes a defense effort to that end,” he says. “I particularly understand it in light of China’s history. It’s also understandable that the United States doesn’t want any region dominated by a superpower, so that creates a certain balance. The two elements in that balance, namely China and the United States, also have to lead in cooperation.” Kissinger has rightly come to understand that, in today’s linked world, we need a fresh approach: partnership must become an integral part of the balance of power in any new geopolitical arrangement. The danger of war looms most menacingly if the balance of power is reduced to only a military dimension. With no common intent on any front, all else will dwell in the dark shadow of distrust in which each will seek advantage over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a US-China partnership to work, as Chinese diplomat Fu Ying once told Kissinger, the United States must be able to accept China as “an equal brother.” But that goes both ways: China must also step up with a global perspective on its responsibility that it has never before held—not as an honorary member of the Western club, but as coarchitect of world order. This recognition is the cornerstone of a strategy of evolutionary stability that aims to avoid a power vacuum by maintaining order over the slow course of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As difficult as it may be for the United States to share leadership in the Asia-Pacific region that it has dominated for decades, it will also be a big concession for China to embrace the notion of a balance of power instead of a series of tributaries. In the end, where differences remain, the two nations must ensure their mutual interests by accommodating each other with these principles of security: restraint in the use of power, reciprocity in actions taken, transparency over intentions, and sufficient capabilities and resilience to assure the ability to strike back and restore equilibrium if attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new global order we envision on the basis of the United States and China as indispensable partners would accommodate the return of diversity from a long interlude of hegemony—for the first time in history “diversity connected in real time”—and would be structured geopolitically as “one world, many systems.” This new rules-based system would be a kind of “Westphalia plus” in which partnerships on global issues of concern to all form a constituent part of the balance of power between and among states—in other words, a system in which trust-building cooperative arrangements and institutions are not an alternative but themselves a factor in the overall configuration of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stabilize world order on these terms, the United States and China must serve as guarantors of global public goods—open trade and investment, stable financial flows, climate protection, freedom of travel and navigation, sharing of health knowledge and scientific advances. The cornerstone of a “non-value-based” partnership founded on convergent interests will inevitably have to coexist with “value-based plurilateralism” among the like-minded. Its role would be to mobilize joint efforts of those whose values are aligned in the pursuit of common ends without resort to the use of force or organized subversion against others—with the exception of the most egregious humanitarian violations by a state or organized groups within a state. When values conflict, “taking a stand, not taking sides” would be the modus operandi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;____________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excerpted from “Renovating Democracy: Governing in the Age of Globalization and Digital Capitalism” by Nathan Gardels and Nicolas Berggruen, published by the University of California Press. © 2019 by the Regents of the University of California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 23:43:06 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“She is on her way out.

An American prohibition against the use of equipment made by Huawei had long been mooted, out of fear that China’s spooks could use it to spy on its geopolitical rival. The largest Chinese telecoms firm has in effect been prevented from selling its kit in America since 2012. Big American mobile operators have already renounced the use of its gear for their fifth-generation (5G) networks. The administration of Donald Trump has attempted to browbeat Western allies into forswearing Huawei too; imposing a ban of its own was expected to help with the cajoling. Until now, the only other country to have enacted one is Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the executive order that Donald Trump issued on May 15th, declaring a national emergency, was much broader in scope than most had anticipated. It named neither Huawei nor China explicitly. But it said that “foreign adversaries”, keen to spy on America, were “creating and exploiting vulnerabilities” in local technology and services that store “vast amounts of sensitive information” and “facilitate the digital economy”. It said that unrestricted acquisition or use of such technologies was “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy” of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the ban’s woolliest bits—who counts as a foreign adversary, for instance—should be clarified with the help of American spies within the next 150 days. But if there was any doubt about its chief intended target, a separate ban issued later that day made things crystal clear. The Department of Commerce said that it has added Huawei to a list of companies deemed a risk to American national security. When it takes effect (the timing is unclear), dozens of Huawei’s affiliates will be prohibited from buying hardware and software from American firms without government approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Huawei said it is “ready and willing to engage with the US government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security” and that restricting it would only limit America to “inferior yet more expensive alternatives”. It also said that “unreasonable restrictions” would raise “serious legal issues”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samm Sacks of New America, a think-tank in Washington, DC, says that this direct interdiction is “a complete shock”. It had for months been talked about among companies and those close to policymakers as the “nuclear option”. Unlike in the case of ZTE, another Chinese telecoms giant that was briefly banned outright from sourcing American parts and software last spring, Huawei can continue to buy them as long as its foreign suppliers secure licences. But companies are being told that there will be no exemptions, according to Ms Sacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observers nonetheless expect a rush to apply for such licences. Those who doubt, for now, that a blanket American ban is inevitable say its intent is to make Huawei’s kit look like a less dependable option to service providers elsewhere. In Europe, any orders for gear that Huawei had been expecting, for instance, will now be upset. Reports emerged earlier this year of international telecoms carriers stockpiling equipment, as fears of an American ban grew. Some were burnt by the ZTE prohibition, which denied them access to warehouses holding gear that they had already bought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ZTE was banned in April 2018, the effect was crippling. In 2016 UBS, a bank, had estimated that at least four-fifths of its products relied on American parts. Chips designed by America’s Qualcomm were in about 70% of its smartphones. ZTE posted a loss of 7bn yuan ($1bn) for 2018, compared with a profit of 4.6bn yuan the previous year. In barely three months the ban brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy, before it earned a reprieve from Mr Trump, after a personal appeal from China’s president, Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few observers expect Huawei to flirt with bankruptcy in the way ZTE has. But it, too, looks vulnerable. Although its HiSilicon unit designs some of its chips in-house, the company outsources their manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, a giant chipmaker, which could be swayed by the Americans. The only other factories capable of producing cutting-edge chips are owned by Samsung, a South Korean firm—and South Korea is another American ally. Like all makers of mobile chips, it relies heavily on intellectual property licensed from ARM, a British firm. Products from its handsets to data centres and cloud-computing services could all be hurt by the ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming amid an intensifying trade war between America and China—and given the ZTE precedent—the ban on Huawei may also be a bargaining chip in talks. At a minimum, it will be used as one with recalcitrant European allies. But as officials hash out the scope of Mr Trump’s executive order, more than just the usual suspects could find themselves ensnared. Ms Sacks says that it could become a “discretionary tool” for America to use against Chinese companies as it sees fit—including against perceived risks to the country’s entire digital infrastructure. Its wording is broad enough to encompass all manner of Chinese technology firms, from e-commerce and digital-payments giants like Alibaba to hardware-makers such as Lenovo.

The Masters sets itself apart for occurring at the same venue every year, fielding the smallest number of players and maintaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.golf-monthly.co.uk/tour/us-masters/masters-history-records/masters-green-jacket-126753&quot;&gt;quaint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.thoughtco.com/on-the-menu-the-champions-dinner-at-the-masters-1564552&quot;&gt;traditions&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. Open is distinguished by famously punishing courses, which are sometimes so brutal that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_U.S._Open_(golf)&quot;&gt;no one finishes below par&lt;/a&gt;. And the Open Championship, known as the British Open outside the United Kingdom, is the oldest of the four (it began in 1860); the only one not played in America; and is regularly held on coastal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)&quot;&gt;links courses&lt;/a&gt;, characterised by firm greens and shifting winds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the PGA? From 1916 to 1957, it was the only major with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play&quot;&gt;match-play format&lt;/a&gt;. But ever since it adopted the same 72-hole stroke-play format as the others, it has lacked a clear identity. Its only unique characteristic is reserving 20 spaces in the field for resident professionals at golf clubs, slightly diluting its level of competition. Aside from that, it mimics the U.S. Open, but has historically been played at less prestigious courses. The event’s occasional use of the slogan “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg6Rr_ZthCA&quot;&gt;This Is Major&lt;/a&gt;” carried a distinct note of protesting too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, however, the PGA Championship will be the focus not just of keen golf fans but of the sporting world at large. In advance of the 2019 season, the event was moved from August to May. This made it the second major of the year rather than the fourth, and created a regular drumbeat of one major per month from April through July. And fortuitously, after an 11-year-long drought, the 43-year-old Tiger Woods stormed back from scandal and injury to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/04/14/tiger-woods-wins-his-fifth-masters-in-a-comeback-for-the-ages&quot;&gt;win the 15th major of his career at the Masters last month&lt;/a&gt;. All of a sudden, Mr Woods’s quest to surpass Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major victories looks very much alive. This year’s PGA Championship, held on the Bethpage Black Course in New York state—a test so difficult its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://nypost.com/2019/05/14/pga-championship-the-fight-behind-bethpage-blacks-famous-sign&quot;&gt;warning sign has become a golf-world meme&lt;/a&gt;—represents Mr Woods’s first opportunity to narrow his deficit relative to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/10/06/why-jack-nicklaus-called-golden-bear-nickname-logo-99551&quot;&gt;Golden Bear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EAGLE, &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;’s statistical prediction system for major tournaments, returns for the PGA as well, after taking a mild bruising at the Masters. (You can follow its predictions, which update live every two minutes, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://eagle.economist.com&quot;&gt;http://eagle.economist.com&lt;/a&gt;.) Although our model recognised that Mr Woods had played well enough during his comeback to rank among golf’s elite once again, its evaluation of his prowess was somewhat &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/06/our-masters-forecast-is-lukewarm-on-tiger-woods&quot;&gt;more conservative than that of betting markets&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, EAGLE considered him the ninth-best player in the world, with around a 2% chance of victory; punters put him third or fourth, with roughly a 5% chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Mr Woods has proven he is still capable of winning a major, bettors’ view of him has improved once again. His current market price corresponds to a 6.6% chance of winning the PGA, making him the narrow fourth-favourite behind Dustin Johnson (8.5%), Brooks Koepka (7.8%), and Rory McIlroy (7.3%). No one else exceeds 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet EAGLE, undeterred by the toll Mr Woods may have taken on its reputation last month, is a stubborn bird. Mr Woods has not played in any events since his Masters victory, giving the model a paltry four new rounds’ worth of data with which to update its assessment of him. Moreover, his triumph at Augusta National was slightly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2019/04/16/tiger-woods-made-our-golf-model-look-silly-have-we-learned-a-lesson&quot;&gt;less impressive than it appears&lt;/a&gt;. He beat the field’s average score by a modest ten strokes, a margin that historically has been sufficient to win a major just 8% of the time. By that measure, his showing at the Masters was actually slightly worse than he did at last year’s PGA Championship, when he was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2018/08/14/despite-woodss-charge-the-pga-was-brooks-koepkas-to-lose&quot;&gt;runner-up to Mr Koepka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Woods is not the only betting favourite about whom EAGLE harbours reservations. The model is just as cautious about Mr Koepka, who claimed the last PGA Championship by two strokes over Mr Woods, and then lost this year’s Masters to him by a single shot. More than any other golfer at the moment, Mr Koepka seems to play up or down to the importance of the competition. He has won three of the past six majors he has entered, and tied for second in another. Yet these successes have alternated with missteps that should be rarer for an elite player, such as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.pgatour.com/roundrecap/2018/r060/2/36689.html&quot;&gt;eight-over-par second round&lt;/a&gt; at the Tour Championship last September, which Mr Woods won. Blending the good with the bad, the sometimes erratic Mr Koepka’s average scores during the 67 rounds he has played since winning the PGA Championship rank just 15th in this year’s field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that some players rise to the occasion while others wilt under pressure is not necessarily only the stuff of hagiographic nostalgia films. In fact, predictions for scores in majors can be modestly improved by taking account of the gap between players’ past performances in majors and their work in other events. However, this effect is exceedingly small. And its biggest beneficiary is not Mr Koepka but rather Jason Day, who historically has played about a full stroke per round better in majors than he has on lesser stages. EAGLE agrees with punters that Mr Koepka and Mr Woods, the winner and runner-up at the last PGA Championship, have similar chances of lofting the Wanamaker Trophy this time. However, it puts those probabilities in the range of 2.5-3%, less than half the markets’ estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By definition, win probabilities are zero-sum. As a result, if Mr Woods and Mr Koepka stand less of a chance than is popularly thought, someone else must be under-valued. As it has been for every major since the start of 2018, EAGLE’s top pick to win is Mr Johnson. He has just reclaimed the top spot in the official world rankings from Justin Rose, and for good reason. After adjusting for playing conditions, Mr Johnson’s average scores during the past nine months are 0.13 strokes per round better than those of Mr McIlroy, and 0.31 strokes per round better than anyone else’s. However, these two superstars’ prowess is no secret. The chances of victory EAGLE assigns to them, at 6.8% and 4.4%, are actually slightly below those seen in betting markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where might a bettor looking to make a buck—or simply a fan hoping to impress friends with her savvy—turn to look for a surprise winner? Among top-tier players, the one who has received curiously little buzz in advance of the event is Paul Casey. Mr Casey is to an extent Mr Koepka’s mirror image: he has 19 professional victories, but has never won a major. Moreover, he has missed the cut in each of the past two majors, as well as in the prestigious Players Championship. At the age of 41, his best years are likely behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Mr Casey is off to a blazing start to 2019. He successully defended his 2018 title against a strong field at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valspar_Championship&quot;&gt;Valspar Championship&lt;/a&gt;, and has secured four more top-five finishes in his past nine events. He currently sits 12th in both the official world rankings and EAGLE’s, just a bit behind Mr Woods. At this stage of his career, Mr Casey probably is not quite the player that Mr Woods is. But Mr Woods’s chances of winning the PGA Championship are surely not five times greater than Mr Casey’s, as the markets suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of the television cameras will rarely waver from the likes of Mr Woods and Mr McIlroy during the early days of the event. However, the chaotic nature of golf is such that the eventual victor is likely to come from the long tail of players with records even less distinguished than Mr Casey’s. Among players with odds longer than 100 to one, EAGLE is partial to Webb Simpson, who won the U.S. Open in 2012 and finished fifth in the Masters last month; Matthew Fitzpatrick, an up-and-coming British youngster still hunting for his first major; and Joost Luiten, a Dutchman who holds the rare distinction of having made both a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.sbnation.com/2017/8/10/16127984/pga-championship-2017-joost-luiten-hole-in-one-ace&quot;&gt;hole-in-one in a major&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq4RJu6ZbUw&quot;&gt;rarer-than-rare albatross&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) overall life expectancy fell for the second time in three years in 2017, driven by a surge in opioid overdoses and suicide, at which whites are most at risk. But a new paper by Lauren Gaydosh, a sociologist at the Center for Medicine Health and Society at Vanderbilt University suggests that unhappiness and its symptoms are widespread in middle age Americans of all races and ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Gaydosh and her colleagues used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to track the health and behaviour of a group of Americans first surveyed in the mid-1990s when they were teenagers. They were most recently interviewed in 2016 when they were in their late 30s and 40s. The researchers studied the data on depressive symptoms and reported contemplation of suicide. They also tracked behaviours including heavy drinking and marijuana use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that depressive symptoms, thoughts of suicide, drinking and marijuana use all fell during the period when respondents were in their twenties and then increased during the last decade as they entered their thirties and early forties.  This pattern was similar across all groups: whites, blacks and Hispanics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, the researchers found that for depressive symptoms in particular, average rates amongst blacks and Hispanics were higher than among whites. In the most recent round of the survey, one third of blacks with a high school education or less reported that they had been diagnosed with depression or anxiety. That was slightly higher than the proportion of less-educated whites.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While thoughts of suicide were slightly higher on average amongst less-educated whites than other groups, the pattern of change over time was similar. Again, heavy drinking was higher amongst whites than other groups, but both the uptick in drinking as well as smoking marijuana in the last ten years was driven by those whites surveyed who had more than a high school education, not the less-educated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the study’s conclusion that misery is spreading across the whole cohort reaching middle age, it also suggests that opioid abuse along with other prescription drug abuse and illegal drug use remain much higher amongst non-college educated whites. Other research has shown that whites commit suicide at a higher rate than blacks and Hispanics: according to the CDC, white non-Hispanic Americans commit suicide at around three times the rate of blacks and Hispanics, with the highest and growing toll amongst older men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons why poorly educated white men are unhappy are well documented. In research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research Margherita Borella, an economist, found for that white, non-college-educated Americans born in the 1960s face shorter life expectancies, higher medical expenses, and lower wages compared with those born in the 1940s. This suggests that increased suicide rates among white men may be caused in part by a decline in income and status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet poorly educated white men remain better off than women and minorities. According to Pew Research, in 2018 working women earned 85% of what working men earned per hour. The average black American earned 65%  as much as a white in 2016, only marginally up from 59% in 1970.  For Hispanic workers the wage ratio actually fell from 74% to 65% over that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How should policy makers respond in a way that is both effective and equitable? In a paper published for the National Bureau of Economic Research in April, William Dow, a public health specialist, reported that suicides were lower in states that have increased the minimum wage and provided more generous credits through the EITC (earned income tax credit), a refundable tax credit for low income individuals and families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research by William Evans and Craig Garthwaite, economists, suggests that increasing the EITC also improves self-reported mental health measures among its recipients. Because of lower incomes, minorities and women are more likely to be eligible for EITC payments, and to benefit from minimum wage increases. All of this suggests that a stronger safety net would speed progress toward a more equal America—and reduce the anguish of some who may see themselves losing from the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 06:44:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber is trying to disrupt the road-freight business]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/15/uber-is-trying-to-disrupt-the-road-freight-business]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190518_wbp501.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-05-15T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;May 15th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLORIDA 595 is unappealing, even by truck-stop standards. Odour from a landfill next door permeates the humid air. Planes from a nearby airport buzz overhead. The average American trucker spends two-thirds of working time either in places like this or loadless on the road. So the wheelmen propping up the bar at 595 are giddy about a new breed of smartphone app. For a few years startups like Cargomatic and Convoy have been helping drivers maximise their gainful time behind the wheel by digitising the matching of shipments with lorries. Convoy called itself “Uber for freight”—until 2017, when Uber launched exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Uber had presented itself as just a ride-hailing firm, analysts reckon, it would not have fetched an $82bn valuation when it listed in New York on May 10th. That was predicated on the platform’s potential to disrupt all road transport. Investors are having second thoughts: Uber’s share price fell sharply in its first two days as a public company, before regaining some ground, perhaps on the realisation that the firm may struggle to make money anytime soon. Uber Freight is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, the market the app could disrupt looks huge. Global spending on road freight reached $3.8trn in 2017, says Armstrong &amp;amp; Associates, a consultancy. Companies in America spent over $700bn; freight rates grew by 30% last year owing to a surfeit of cargo and a shortage of drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, only $72bn of American shipments is managed by brokers; most of the rest travels on company lorries. Digital brokers’ slice is wafer-thin. Zion Market Research predicts that their global turnover will increase from around $1bn to $21bn between 2017 and 2026. Uber would need to dominate this market to rival its $9bn in revenue from ride-hailing in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uber touts freight as its third-most-important business after ride-hailing and food delivery. It made up nearly 3% of the firm’s revenues in 2018, but bookings grew by almost 450% that year—faster than any other division. Bill Driegert, boss of Uber Freight, thinks that it can grab most of the brokers’ $72bn, not just the digital bit. No rival can match its software or traffic data—both applicable to lorry logistics, Mr Driegert boasts. Brand recognition, he believes, should help win over drivers reluctant to take jobs from apps no one has heard of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike ride-hailing, which Uber more or less invented, it is a late arrival to freight. Its earlier efforts to disrupt haulage with the purchase of Otto, a startup developing self-driving lorries, came to naught. Grand plans to expand abroad—in March it presented a European app—run up against home-grown incumbents: Timocom of Germany and Teleroute of Belgium in Europe, and Rivigo, a hit Indian app, in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, conventional brokers have shown digital savvy. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that from January to September last year Uber Freight accounted for 30% of haulage-app downloads. That is impressive, but shy of the combined 40% for the three apps from big brokers: C.H. Robinson’s Navisphere, J.B. Hunt’s Carrier 360 and DAT’s Load Board. The boom in road freight provides these companies with cash to plough into apps and algorithms. Landstar, another big broker, claims that a recent software upgrade cut the time needed to process a delivery by nearly a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris O’Brien, C.H. Robinson’s chief commercial officer, disputes the idea that the startups’ data on traffic are better. Lorry routes differ from taxi rides. Brokers can bolt on services—warehousing, last-mile delivery, assistance with customs or unforeseen problems—onto basic haulage. Here, Uber is miles behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokers see their main threat coming not from Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco but from Seattle, home to Amazon. The e-commerce juggernaut launched an app in 2017 to help lorry drivers deliver merchandise to its warehouses. It is rumoured to be working on its own service. Unlike Uber, it has plenty of experience delivering cargo. It sits on more cash than Uber or the brokers. It may not take long to appear in their rear-view mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 06:44:57 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
