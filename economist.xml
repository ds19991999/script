A short stroll away in a leafy park, police were ruining the festive mood. Masked security forces carried away prostrate protesters and hurled them into police vans. They were breaking up a peaceful demonstration by a few hundred dissenters who had gathered to demand change, even as the man who was certain to be elected president promised them continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassym-Jomart Tokayev won a landslide in the election, which was called following the recent resignation of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the iron-fisted leader who had ruled for three decades. Kazakhstan has never held a vote deemed free and fair by credible international observers. This time monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted that the election showed “scant respect for democratic standards”. Despite the presence this time of a candidate critical of the regime, the current election seems only cosmetically different. Mr Tokayev stormed in with 71% of the vote, admittedly far below Mr Nazarbayev’s last triumph, at 98%. Mr Tokayev’s closest rival, Amirzhan Kosanov, trailed on 16%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Kosanov’s presence is a departure from tradition: Mr Nazarbayev used to run against supporters of the regime who took part simply to provide a semblance of competition. This is the first presidential election in 14 years to feature a challenger with a record of opposition, although other critics of the regime worry that he, too, will just provide a democratic veneer. How could it be otherwise in a country that has no formal opposition parties, in which the media and civil society are muzzled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apparent rubber-stamping of Mr Tokayev (he is currently interim president) in this choreographed election is part of an experiment that Mr Nazarbayev has dreamt up for his country, untested elsewhere in the post-Soviet world. He seems to be attempting to install a chosen successor while still alive to secure his legacy, although some speculate that Mr Tokayev is just a seat-warmer in an even more elaborate scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumours are rife that Mr Nazarbayev wants his daughter, Dariga Nazarbayeva, who presides over the Senate, to become president eventually. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s 78-year-old founding father is micromanaging the transition to a president cast in his own image. Mr Tokayev, 66, is a Soviet-era apparatchik who became foreign minister and prime minister after Kazakhstan became independent. His diplomatic skills will help him juggle relations with Kazakhstan’s mighty neighbours, Russia and China, as well as the West--a trick Mr Nazarbayev managed with great dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is at home that Mr Tokayev will face his greatest challenges. Mr Nazarbayev’s resignation has galvanised some of Kazakhstan’s 18m citizens—especially people under 29, who have only ever known Mr Nazarbayev as leader and now make up over half the population—to challenge the regime’s zero-tolerance attitude towards dissent. The authorities in Nur-Sultan, the capital recently renamed after Mr Nazarbayev, have responded by arresting peaceful protesters, rounding up 500 on election day in Nur-Sultan and Almaty and another 100 or so in Almaty on June 10th after results were released. Three mothers are under house arrest after participating in a demonstration in May. The regime has jailed people for demanding a fair election, and briefly detained a man who displayed a blank piece of paper, with no overt criticism of the regime, to test the limits of peaceful expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such repression has backfired. It has become the catalyst for a protest movement rallying around a phrase from a century-old poem urging Kazakhs to shake off the shackles of Russian colonial rule: “I’ve woken up.” Inventive videos have gone viral. Offline, activists have formed a new movement, “Oyan, Qazaqstan” (Wake Up, Kazakhstan). Critics deride them as out-of-touch hipsters, but their nine-point platform for political reforms, including the abolition of the executive presidency, is clear and straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Tokayev is not on record as having studied it. His capacity to conduct reforms is hamstrung by the looming presence of Mr Nazarbayev, who will not want to see the system he fashioned dismantled, or even tinkered with. Despite the country’s oil wealth many complain of unemployment, low wages, corruption, and a lack of access to housing, health care and education. Before the election, Mr Tokayev took to Twitter to promise “political modernisation” and reforms to tackle festering socio-economic grievances. “Old problems—new solutions,” he tweeted brightly. Kassymkhan Kapparov, a respected economist and pro-democracy activist, riposted tartly: “Old problems—old people who created them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 23:01:30 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The race to become Britain’s next PM]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/10/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm]]></link><description>&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-10T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 10th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HERESA MAY&lt;/small&gt; stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7th.

Growth faltered, the currency slumped and foreign donors stopped contributing to the budget. The results have been “devastating”, says Denise Namburete, a civil-society activist, describing health centres that have gone two years without medicines. American prosecutors are pursuing eight people involved in the scandal, including three foreign bankers and a former finance minister, on charges of money-laundering and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mozambique case may be unusual. Or it may not. New kinds of lending are so opaque that even the IMF is scratching its head about how much governments truly owe. In some places the mystery is loans from China and other emerging lenders. In others it is advance payments from oil traders, liabilities from public-private partnerships or hidden loans from commercial banks. The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a group of banks and financial institutions, has responded to mounting concern by drafting principles on debt transparency. Finance ministers of G20 countries endorsed them at a summit in Fukuoka, Japan, on June 8th-9th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IIF principles are voluntary and would apply only to lending from the private sector, not from states. Lenders would disclose any loans they make to low-income governments or state firms within 60-120 days of funds being released. Details would include the purpose of the loan, its structure and a range within which the interest rate falls. The data would be kept in a repository at an international institution, perhaps the IMF or World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they are so minded, the G20 countries could use their voting power at the IMF to insist it hosts the data. Their endorsement will also have weight with the private sector at large, says Sonja Gibbs of the IIF. Although lenders benefit from knowing more about government debts, some are reluctant to share information they consider commercially sensitive. They will need to be pressed to participate. “It will be a name and shame game,” says Mark Plant of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank. “That sometimes works, it sometimes doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to give the scheme bite? One proposal is that sovereign-loan contracts that are not publicly disclosed within 30 days of signature should be unenforceable in court. Most international loans are made under New York or English law—as Mozambique’s dodgy deals were—so tweaking the rules in those two jurisdictions would be a good start. Case law and legal institutions are so well established that business would be unlikely to shift elsewhere, argues Tim Jones of Jubilee Debt Campaign, the British charity behind the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 51 members of parliament have written to the British chancellor in support of Jubilee’s proposal, among them former secretaries of state for international development from the Labour and Conservative parties. On June 5th the opposition Labour party said it would implement the idea if it wins power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal changes are not yet on the G20’s agenda. But rising debt levels are fuelling a sense of urgency. The IMF reckons that 44% of low-income countries are now in debt distress or at high risk of it—even without more nasty surprises. The average developing country’s external-debt payments have risen from 6.6% of government revenue in 2010 to 12.2% in 2018, calculates Jubilee. When politicians borrow clandestinely, it is their people who foot the bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 19:39:57 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico rejoices after averting Donald Trump’s tariffs threat]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/09/mexico-rejoices-after-averting-donald-trumps-tariffs-threat]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_blp902.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-09T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 9th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALL IT a victory. Compared with crippling tariffs on all exports to the United States that President Donald Trump had threatened to impose, starting at 5% on June 10th and escalating to 25%, just about any deal was going to look good for Mexico. &lt;br/&gt;News of an accord reached by Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, to have the tariffs suspended indefinitely caused relief and celebration across the country—even before its contents became clear. “Ebrard deactivates Trump,” screeched the front page of El Heraldo, a newspaper, the morning after the deal on June 7th. “Mexico wins,” ran another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A saga that had threatened to hobble the still-young presidency of Andrés Manuel López Obrador became instead a crisis averted. Mexico’s president announced that a rally he had planned in central Tijuana in “defence of national dignity” would now become a celebration of Mexico’s success at the negotiating table. On June 8th governors, bishops and unionists joined the president on the stage at a traffic intersection as locals climbed atop bus stops and taco stands to glimpse the festivities. “To President Donald Trump I raise not a closed fist, but an open and honest hand,” said Mr López Obrador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he is not the only president doing a victory lap. Mr Trump wants to turn Mexico into the wall that he promised but has so far failed to build. He tweeted his satisfaction that Mexico would take “strong measures” towards halting the inflow of Central American migrants. In May some 144,000 people tried to cross the southern border of the United States, double the number in February. Almost all of them had travelled through Mexico rather than from it. Mr Trump’s defenders argue that using tariffs as a threat to force Mexico to get tough on migration was a masterstroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accord includes the expansion of “Remain In Mexico”—a fledgling scheme that forces migrants to wait in Mexico while their claims for asylum in the United States are processed— from a few checkpoints to the entire American-Mexican border. From June 10th Mexico will also deploy 6,000 troops of its newly created national guard to two states—Chiapas, bordering Guatemala, and Oaxaca, which has a narrow isthmus—to stop migrants and people-smugglers. That will dent the number of migrants reaching the United States, though flows across the US-Mexico border tend to dip anyway in the scorching months of June and July. The sides did not set specific reduction targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal allows the United States to demand more from Mexico within 90 days if numbers do not fall as much as the Trump administration would like. But it is less impressive than Mr Trump claims. “Remain In Mexico” was already set for expansion. Mexican officials describe the deployment of the national guard as an “acceleration” of what they were planning to do anyway. Mr Trump tweeted that Mexico had agreed to “immediately buy large quantities of agricultural product from our great patriot farmers”. Mr Ebrard clarified that, if spared Mr Trump’s recession-inducing tariffs, Mexico would be in a better position to buy many different things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico has toed a fine line in negotiations. Mr Lopez López Obrador initially responded to Mr Trump’s threat by penning an affectionate letter—a strategy for presidential seduction borrowed from Kim Jong Un. Mexico froze two-dozen bank accounts linked to people-smuggling operations and locked up two activists involved in helping so-called migrant caravans travel through Mexico. But it also rebuffed other requests, particularly pressure to accept “safe third country” status, which would, in effect, allow the United States to reject the asylum application of anyone who set foot in Mexico beforehand, and send back to Mexico those who make it into the United States. Mexicans officials say they also had to explain to their counterparts that their border with Guatemala, porous and often ignored by locals, could be strengthened but not entirely sealed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The peso climbed upon news of the deal, but not to the level it was before Mr Trump first unsheathed his tariffs threat. That suggests that markets have priced in the chance of a return to conflict. It also suggests that investors do not believe that the USMCA, Mr Trump’s recently struck revamp of the NAFTA trade pact, provides the kind of economic certainty that free-trade deals are supposed to. From North America to North Korea, Mr Trump has made a habit of threatening to abandon his own deals even after reaching them through brinkmanship. Mexican negotiators know that Mr Trump can enrapture his fans and distract his enemies by chucking bombs at Mexico, and has every reason to do so again before his bid for re-election in 2020. “It’s like Alcoholics Anonymous, we live one day at a time,” says one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of Mr López Obrador critics, it is he, not Mr Trump, who has performed a humiliating climbdown. Mr López Obrado entered office promising to end the mass deportations of Central Americans carried out by past Mexican presidents. Indeed, the drop in the number of migrants detained during his first months in office, which American officials blame for the rise in illegal crossings, drew Mr Trump’s ire. Despite rhetoric about respecting migrants’ rights, Mexican officials concede that deportations are all but certain to rocket. &lt;br/&gt;Tijuana thus made for a bittersweet location for Mr López Obrador’s victory rally. The city is not just the cradle of Mexican-American integration, or a state that the president’s party swept in state elections on June 2nd. It is also the final destination for many of the migrants on their way to America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those thronging Tijuana were two strolling visitors who chanced upon the president’s speech. Valerio Doctor, a Haitian migrant, had been in Tijuana for 15 days, following a three-month trip mostly by bus from Ecuador (many migrants arrive in Mexico from afar via Ecuador or Chile, the nearest countries with generous visa-free travel rules). In Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, he had five children and no work. So with his friend he left to seek a path to prosperity elsewhere. In a crowd Mr Doctor watches Mr López Obrador vow to fortify the very border he and his friend had just crossed. Until that moment, the pair knew nothing of the deal. Mr Doctor still hopes to cross to the United States or, if it will not have him, to stay in Mexico. How the deal struck with so much fanfare and consequence 24 hours earlier will affect him is still unclear. The lot of poor migrants is often hard and uncertain. For those who try to follow Mr Doctor, it is likely to be harder and more uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 04:39:59 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Denmark’s social democrats beat the migrant-bashers at their game]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/06/09/denmarks-social-democrats-beat-the-migrant-bashers-at-their-game]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_eup506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-09T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 9th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOCIAL DEMOCRATS in much of Europe are living through torrid times. In France and the Netherlands, once-mighty centre-left parties have been reduced to bit players; in Italy and Germany they have been pushed into third place behind populists or Greens. There are many reasons for their decline, but one is the politics of immigration: centre-left parties are seen as too permissive by many of their traditional working-class voters, who have switched to supporting anti-immigrant populist parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the victory by Denmark’s Social Democrats (SD) in an election on June 5th is an important test case. After losing power in 2015, the SD got tough on immigration and integration. It sought to take back the initiative from the Danish People’s Party (DPP), an anti-immigrant populist outfit that has captured an increasing share of the working-class vote over the past two decades. The DPP has dragged the country’s immigration policy far in its own direction: the centre-right government of Lars Lokke Rasmussen, which has governed since 2015 through a confidence-and-supply deal with the DPP, has slowed the arrival of asylum-seekers to a trickle with tough policies such as mandating that their valuables be confiscated to pay for the costs of housing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD, under its leader, Mette Frederiksen, wants to go further in some ways. It has proposed an annual cap on “non-Western” immigration, and it wants to encourage foreign retirees to leave Denmark by letting them keep their state pensions. Ms Frederiksen and other SD politicians speak of the problem of immigrants forming “parallel societies” in Denmark, and of the need to eliminate immigrant “ghettos”. Whereas the party was once seen as relatively liberal on immigration, it has by now shifted its image to a group sceptical of newcomers, which insists that those in the country integrate into the dominant culture. If the SD’s strategy succeeded, many analysts thought, Europe’s other centre-left European parties might have a model to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the result of the election came in, though, it was inconclusive. As polls predicted, the SD came first. It appears likely to return to government (pending coalition negotiations, which will start this week). But its share of the vote was 26%, down a bit from 26.3% in 2015. In contrast, the share of Venstre, Mr Rasmussen’s centre-right liberal party, rose from 19.5% to 23%. If Ms Frederiksen becomes prime minister, she will owe it to the strong performance of other parties on the left, which did not embrace tougher migration policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DPP was indeed devastated. It lost more than half its vote share, falling from 21% to 8%. But just 12% of its previous voters shifted to SD, according to exit polls; more went to Venstre (17%). If SD’s strategy was to win back voters from the far right, it did not seem to have worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The equivocal results touched off a fierce debate in other countries with struggling centre-left parties, such as the Netherlands, where the Labour party’s share fell from 25% in the 2012 election to just 6% in 2017. Some analysts saw the SD’s win as proof that tough immigration policies work. “If the Dutch social democrats want to win back their original support base, they have to take on immigration,” wrote Kemal Rijken, a left-leaning political scientist, two days after the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others pointed to the SD’s failure to raise its vote as evidence that the centre-left cannot hope to win such voters back. Tarik Abou-Chadi, a political scientist at the University of Zurich, argued that the paucity of DPP supporters switching to SD made it clear that even under “favourable circumstances” as in Denmark, anti-immigration politics could not be the future for social-democratic parties in countries like Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some in Denmark, however, said foreign interpreters were drawing the wrong conclusions because they misunderstood the strategy. The SD failed to increase its own vote share because it lost more voters to other leftist parties than it gained from the DPP. The Socialist People’s Party (SF), a green outfit, raised its share from 4.2% to 7%, while the left-liberal Radical Liberals (RV) went from 4.6% to 8%. This, however, was part of the plan: win voters from the right, even at the cost of losing some to the left, and you have shifted the overall centre of gravity, allowing a left-leaning coalition to seize power. The point was not to win the debate on immigration, but to neutralise it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By placing themselves where they did on immigration and integration, the SD took away a weapon from the liberals and conservatives. It took the heat out of the debate,” says Karina Kosiara-Pedersen, a political scientist. Because voters expected a tough immigration policy from whoever won the election, the contest refocused on other issues: first climate change, followed by education. Those are issues on which Danes currently trust the left more than the right. Meanwhile, the DPP was hurt by the entry of two new parties even farther to the right on immigration: the New Right party, which won 2%, and Stram Kurs (“Hard Line”), an extremist populist party that took just enough votes to damage the DPP but not enough to get into parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is whether the SD’s strategy can be imitated by Europe’s other centre-left parties. Ms Frederiksen thinks it may be specific to Denmark. Depoliticising immigration by adopting tougher positions may work in countries—such as Sweden, Norway and Finland—with strong social-democratic parties that command loyalty on other issues. But in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, voters have lost confidence in social-democratic parties for a wide range of reasons, especially economic ones. They are seen as complicit in labour-market reforms which left-wing voters dislike, and share the blame for austerity measures enacted during the euro crisis. That said, in Spain and Portugal, which have also undergone wrenching economic adjustments, the centre-left is doing well without adopting an anti-immigrant line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish results may thus hold lessons mainly for the rest of the Nordic countries. But elsewhere in Europe, social-democratic parties have problems which an anti-immigrant turn seems unlikely to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 03:40:53 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost workers of the world, form a guild!]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2019/06/09/ghost-workers-of-the-world-form-a-guild]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_wbp507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-09T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 9th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE DEBATE about the future of work tends to divide commentators into two camps. The optimistic case is that technology may cause temporary disruption but will ultimately result in economic growth and thus more jobs. Combine harvesters reduced the need for agricultural labourers and personal computers eliminated the typing pool, but the displaced workers found jobs in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pessimistic case is that new technology, even if it does not cause mass unemployment, will create a “digital divide”. The future will resemble a high-tech Downton Abbey, with the skilled elite lording it over the rest. Unskilled workers will be delivering pizzas to, and cleaning the bathrooms of, the likes of Elon Musk and Tim Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new report* from McKinsey veers more into the optimistic camp. It predicts that men and women will be roughly equally affected by automation over the next decade, with 21% of working males and 20% of females losing their jobs by 2030. In the developed world, McKinsey estimates that men will tend to lose machine-operating jobs and women will lose clerical and service roles. But new jobs will be created, if not necessarily for the same people: women will find work in the expanding health-care industry and men in the professional, scientific and technical fields (a higher proportion of men than women have science degrees).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of these jobs will be well paid, especially for women, says McKinsey—just as, according to left-wing critics, the jobs boom of recent years has been in low-paid work (though data suggest that high-paying ones also rose fast). On the bright side, discouraged workers have rejoined the labour market as the economy has boomed, while technology has made it easier for employers to find workers (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much of this low-paid work is the result of the gig economy? Not much so far; it only represents about 1% of American employment. But in their book, “Ghost Work”, Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri forecast that what they call “on-demand work” will reach 60% of the global workforce by 2055. They define this category to include those who work for temporary staffing agencies, have short-term contracts or who accept work from employers through websites or apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this makes it sound as if the future of jobs will look like the past. Before the days of the factory and the office, many workers were part of a “putting-out system”, in which merchants hired them to undertake specific tasks, such as spinning or weaving, for which they were paid a piece rate. The attraction to employers is that such work is cheap. The authors quote marketing executives as saying their company could save up to 40% by not paying benefits and saving on office space. Furthermore, in two of the main markets where on-demand workers toil, America and India, they have little access to the legal protections associated with formal employment. A digital Downton Abbey, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the new forms of employment have a plus side. Many workers in emerging markets relish the opportunity to work at home, and at times of their choosing. They are only expecting to supplement their family’s other sources of income. On some platforms, workers are identified by a sequence of letters and numbers, meaning that they are free from discrimination on the grounds or age or sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers may also look to the past to find a way to organise themselves. Some have set up online forums which share information on the most reliable employers. Ms Gray and Mr Suri suggest these could be expanded to create the equivalent of medieval guilds which could enable workers to learn new skills. Such guilds could also act as a repository for employees’ work records. At the moment, it is as hard—or harder—to transfer your work rating from one online platform to another as it is to wrest your user data from Facebook. Lack of interoperability means workers have to start each contract from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsible employers could pledge to use only workers from guilds and to apply minimum standards on issues such as prompt payment. They will benefit from a more reliable and skilful employees. That way, if workers of the world unite, everyone may gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 01:18:45 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A new rendering of Christianity’s best-known supplication]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/06/08/a-new-rendering-of-christianitys-best-known-supplication]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190608_BLP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-08T15:39:41Z&quot;&gt;Jun 8th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE world of conservative Catholics, bent on proving that the current pontiff is a theologically dubious innovator, it feels as though Pope Francis has just given them a fresh ammunition. According to newspaper reports in many countries, the Argentine pontiff has just changed the Lord’s Prayer, the supplication beginning with the words “Our Father” which was taught by Jesus Christ and is used by just about all his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some traditionalists, such recklessness is tantamount to changing the Declaration of Independence, in other words fiddling about with a set of words which, once delivered, was meant to stand for all time. Imagine how foolhardy this sort of tampering would look to Muslims, who believe that God’s message was revealed at a particular time, in a particular form of Arabic words, of which not one iota can be changed. For a devout Muslim, renderings of the Koran into other languages are an approximation at best; the Arabic original is the only definitive one. For a devout Jew, only the Hebrew original of the Torah has any real standing as the word of God, though slightly different versions of that text exist. Still, the fact that Christianity now accepts the idea of a spiritually inspired translation, on a par with the original, makes things more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what has really happened with that Christian prayer? In 2017, Pope Francis told an Italian TV channel that he was unhappy with the standard translations of one particular line in the prayer which Christ proposed. That line is “lead us not into temptation” or in Italian “non indurci in tentazione”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained: “It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation… I am the one who falls. It is not Him pushing me into temptation to then see how far I have fallen. A father doesn’t do that, a father helps you to get up immediately. It is Satan who leads us into temptation, that’s his department.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of that papal bomb-shell, it was left up to national bishops’ conferences, responsible for translation into their respective languages, to decide how to respond. In fact, well before Francis spoke, French bishops had decreed a change similar to one he recommended: Ne nous laisse pas entrer en tentation (do not let us enter into temptation) replaced Ne nous soumets pas à la tentation which could mean something like “Do not subject us to temptation.” Indeed Francis gave the French bishops credit for having blazed a new linguistic trail, and they may well have given him the idea of proposing similar changes in other tongues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Catholic prelates of Germany, and of England and Wales, considered the matter and decided to let their existing (“lead us not into..”) versions stand. The latest development, prompting the recent headlines, is that Italy’s bishops, in consultation with the Holy See, have given final approval to an Italian version which reflects the pontiff’s thinking and will be used in a forthcoming Missal or prayer-book. The new rendering is “non abbandonarci alla tentazione…” meaning something like “do not abandon us to temptation...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So who is right? Your correspondent will not claim to sit in theological judgement over the pope but the question does have a purely linguistic dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that “lead us not into temptation” is a pretty accurate rendering of the early Greek texts from which later Bibles have been translated. “Do not bring us into temptation” might be even closer. In fact, the word whose rendering needs careful thought is not the verb but the noun, peirasmos, the term which is usually translated as “temptation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both ancient and modern Greek, it has a range of senses, covering many different things, trivial and grave, that might try, test or vex us or somehow throw us off course. In the context it is reasonable to assume that trials of a more serious kind are being referred to. So a loose but broadly fair translation of the contested phrase might be something like “do not test us more than we can bear…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is what some people high up in the American Catholic hierarchy seem to think, anyway. Consult the text of the Bible as published on the website of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and you will find the following rather memorable, but perhaps alarming, version of the relevant verse (Matthew 6:13), taken from the New American Bible (Revised Edition) of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do not subject us to the final test, but deliver us from the evil one…” The American rendering is a bold one but it does avert one of the potential problems posed by the new papally-blessed Italian formula. To an impious soul, being “abandoned to temptation” might sound enjoyable, indeed almost… irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:40:23 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[James Ellroy finally has happiness in his sights]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/news/2019/06/08/james-ellroy-finally-has-happiness-in-his-sights]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190601_blp506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-08T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 8th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190406_OPP601_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190406_OPP601_2.jpg 200w,

It was published in the June/July 2019 issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a dark Saturday afternoon in February James Ellroy, America’s pre-eminent crime novelist and chronicler of depravity and excess, was having problems with his central heating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/WPAdBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s cold in here, isn’t it?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agreed that it was. Ellroy, who is tall and bald, and looks like a cross between Michel Foucault and Uncle Fester from the Addams Family, got up and spent a few moments peering and poking at the thermostat. Then he announced that he would phone his girlfriend—and former wife—Helen Knode, a writer who has her own flat in the same apartment block near Union Station in Denver, Colorado. Knode was at home making turkey chilli. “She should come over and take a look,” he said. “This is not my metier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At bookshop readings and on TV chat-shows, Ellroy presents himself as “the Demon Dog of American fiction”, a confident huckster full of scurrilous gossip and risqué jokes. He has described this shtick as constituting about 7% of who he really is. “I like to fuck with people,” he said, by way of explanation. “Why mince words?” But as he wandered around his flat, trying to determine whether some barely audible sound was a train outside his window or a pipe stirring sluggishly to life, he seemed ungainly and boyish—even sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His possessions are minimal: a few pieces of stark, mid-century furniture, a wall of cellophane-covered hard­backs, some classical CDs, a hi-fi, a boom box and an exercise machine. His fridge is empty apart from shrink-wrapped sausages. For ten years, Ellroy and Knode owned a red-furred bull terrier named Margaret, after his favourite British prime minister. (“She never liked me—she’d just follow me around and bark at me and oppress me furiously as if I was a Labour Party whip.”) These days Ellroy makes do with pictures of dogs and “my Gila monster”, a life-sized artist’s model of a lizard with whom he conducts imaginary conversations. There is no television or computer, no bills, papers or bric-a-brac. The only interruption to this order was the arrival of advance copies of his new novel, “This Storm”, out this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a lifestyle that is peaceful, housebound and nearly Amish in its lack of material indulgence. When I suggested that he seems quite frugal for a bestselling novelist several of whose books have been turned into movies, he replied that he likes to buy cars (he currently owns one car). On an average day, he will eat a bowl of plain oatmeal and drink several cups of black filter coffee, engage in various acts of “prayer and ponder” (he is a non-churchgoing Lutheran), check in with his assistant by fax or on the landline, and take naps. Apart from writing the occasional movie treatment or magazine piece, Ellroy’s only commitment is the monkish, monomaniacal pursuit of what he identifies as “God’s calling for me as a novelist”. “I feel like I’m the great American crime writer,” he told me one afternoon. He weighed the statement for a couple of seconds, as if scrolling through his rivals: Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and so on. Then he said, “You can make that case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy’s breakthrough came in 1987 with “The Black Dahlia”, his seventh novel, which was based on a real-life murder. The novel was the first volume in his LA Quartet, a series of complex detective stories that doubled as a portrait of the city after the second world war. (In 1997, the third book, “L.A. Confidential”, was made into a film starring Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, and won two Oscars.) In Ellroy’s hands, the crime novel became a compound of historical saga, star-crossed romance, pastiche journalism and psychological case-study. His prose heaved with period slang and the books featured a mix of real and invented characters through which Ellroy explored the roots of criminal and even psychopathic behaviour. Dennis Lehane, an American novelist, told me that the LA Quartet is “the towering achievement of American crime fiction. It’s the monolith, the one that came in and casts its shadow over everything else”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the series, Ellroy wanted his next project to be a dense social portrait steeped in vice and crime but without being “beholden to a murder investigation”. The result, in 1995, was “American Tabloid”, perhaps his greatest novel and the beginning of a new sequence. The Underworld USA trilogy recounts major episodes in American history between 1958 and 1972—the Bay of Pigs, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and the Kennedys, the Vietnam war—from the perspective of various invented hit men and hangers-on. Ellroy, who has described his work as an exercise in “moral art”, told me that he found the idea of “killing for money or for dubious ideology particularly horrible and conscienceless. To humanise these characters and to live inside their heads and to connect them to the rise of someone with the inflated reputation of a John F. Kennedy was just too good to pass up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy dislikes talk of prophecy or pertinence, but there are clear parallels between the worlds he created in the LA Quartet and the Underworld USA trilogy and today’s political scene. These volumes, which are being republished by Everyman’s Library this summer, offer a multi-dimensional portrait of American extremity: greasy-palmed complicity between politics and big business, rogue operatives and unchecked institutions, race hatred, police brutality, far-reaching federal investigations, corrupt land deals, lascivious and lying presidents, actress-molesting moguls and populist uprisings. As Knode said one evening at dinner, “It’s Ellroy’s world, we just live in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born Lee Earle Ellroy in Los Angeles in 1948. His mother was a heavy-drinking, free-living nurse from German farming stock in Wisconsin. His father, 17 years her senior, was an accountant, highly competent but idle, who worked briefly as Rita Hayworth’s business manager. When Ellroy was six, his parents divorced. Ellroy lived with his mother but felt ashamed of her behaviour. He has frequently recalled his childhood view of her as “a drunk and a whore”. In June 1958 she was found, raped and strangled, in an ivy patch next to a school playing field in El Monte, California. The case was never solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy and his father didn’t talk about Geneva Hilliker Ellroy. “It was as if, after the coroner’s inquest, the shroud was dropped,” he said. Ellroy took refuge in crime fiction. His father, who was “never cheap”, would buy him at least a book a week, at Chevalier’s Books on Larchmont Boulevard. He estimates that during the summer after his mother died, he read at least 25 Hardy Boys novels. The experience was “a mediated dialogue on my mother’s death. Here I am—decidedly large and strange and prone to volatile curiosities, living with my old man, who talks to the TV and works infrequently and everyone thinks he’s my grandfather, and the un-house-broken dog urinating and defecating with abandon all over the place. And here is Everytown USA. Order is restored. The killer is identified and justice is enacted. And these nice-looking kids have nifty-looking girlfriends and a sidekick and cars and speedboats, and their widowed father is a policeman and has slick threads, and he’ll remarry sooner or later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_BLP504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190601_BLP504.jpg 200w,

It contained a chapter on the rape and vivisection of a 22-year-old would-be starlet Elizabeth Short, the so-called Black Dahlia, a crime that Ellroy has described as “pure misogynist insanity”. That chapter “went through me like a jolt”, said Ellroy: “It was more shocking to me than my mother’s death.” He says his encounter with the case was “the formative experience of my life”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ellroy wasn’t reading, he was acting out. “I’d do anything to get attention,” he said. In 1962 he was enrolled at Fairfax High School, a rare “white-trasher” in a swanky environment. He liked to rile his Jewish classmates and even attended American Nazi party meetings. (“You could not have imagined a more pathetic bunch of fools.”) In a mock election, he was the only kid who—partly for anti-Catholic reasons—voted for Nixon over Kennedy. Sometimes he broke into the homes of his richer neighbours to smell their underwear. But behind the bad behaviour, he felt neglected, frightened, hungry and lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things came to a head in late adolescence: “1965 was pretty heady for me,” he said. “I got kicked out of high school. I joined the army. I flew to basic training, in Fort Polk, Louisiana. I had a big crack-up. I was sent home. My dad was dying. I went back to Fort Polk. Then I returned to LA, because his death was imminent.” His father’s last discernible words to Ellroy were, “Try to pick up every waitress who serves you,” which he calls “a legacy I have fulfilled, with mixed results, dare I say”. After being expelled from the army, Ellroy moved to LA and spent his time boozing, shoplifting, “peeping around” and reading potboilers. At times he lived in Robert Burns Park. To survive, he’d sell his blood plasma. For kicks he’d drink scotch, inhale Benzedrex, smoke weed and annoy hippies (“I’d say ‘Bomb Vietnam’, things like that”). On the night Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, a woman caught him on a rooftop masturbating while high on uppers. He was once beaten up by a drag queen called Peaches. One morning, he woke up in San Francisco and wondered how he’d got there. He was arrested some 40 times, for driving under the influence, public drunkenness, shoplifting, trespassing and burglary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970s Ellroy realised that substance abuse was impeding his other appetites. “I wanted to laugh, I wanted to read, I wanted girls, I wanted to sate my curiosities, I wanted to go to the movies. I loved art. I loved great music. I loved history. I loved looking at pictures in magazines.” He also had an idea for a novel. In 1977 Ellroy joined Alcoholics Anonymous and got clean: he liked the extremity of total abstinence. He found a job as a caddy at the Bel Air Country Club and, aged 30, began to write. His idea became “Brown’s Requiem”, published in 1981 as a little-noticed paperback. Around this time Ellroy walked into the Mysterious Bookshop in New York and told the proprietor, Otto Penzler, “I’m the next big one.” Penzler replied, “Would you forgive me if I reserve judgment?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy wrote a series of straight genre novels before he fulfilled his own prophecy with “The Black Dahlia”. Another writer had already published a novel about the murder of Elizabeth Short, which had been turned into a film, but Ellroy realised that his own peculiar brew of experiences and sensibilities had furnished him with a unique perspective. “I’ve lived in that kind of male excess of booze, dope, girls, high-flying bullshit,” he says, but he is also a veteran of AA, a Christian, conservative, moralist and child of divorce whose mother was murdered. He is both far closer than most novelists to sinful conduct, and more willing to speak the language of moral and religious judgment. Unafraid to join the dots between his own life and his creative output, Ellroy says that his personal suffering “dogged me and informed the texts. Police officers charged with solving a series of baffling crimes, or government provocateurs and buffoons, or the authoritarian figure who needs to impose himself upon external events in order to plumb the secrets of his own identity—I’ve been able to exposit the lonely beating heart of those guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evening in February Ellroy embarked on a rare outdoor excursion—dinner with his friend Jerry Ackerman, a FBI agent and a novelist. Ackerman is a compact, balding man in his late 40s who shares Ellroy’s taste for law and order, mid-century Los Angeles, traditional manners, porkpie hats and beef. Ocean Prime, a restaurant near Ellroy’s apartment, has numerous steak options and elaborately courteous waiters. As we headed out Knode whispered to me: “When people talk about the Denver food scene, this isn’t what they mean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversation touched on Ellroy’s current reading, the thrillers of Daniel Silva, which concern an art restorer who is an agent for Mossad, Israel’s secret service. (“It’s a preposterous combination of trades,” Ellroy said.) Noting how many historical events surface—the arrest of Adolf Eichmann, the Black September conflict—he said, “It’s like a Middle Eastern Ellroy-lite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is that a blurb?” Ackerman asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I think Daniel Silva, who outsells me about 40 to one, would really appreciate that. ‘I’m better than him’—Ellroy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackerman had brought along material for Ellroy’s next novel—a book about the US Treasury. His books often begin with a moment of inspiration. He says that the idea for “The Big Nowhere” (1988) – a conspiracy novel from the LA Quartet that touches on homosexuality, communism, the LA Dodgers, anti-Mexican violence and the legacy of the Holocaust—came to him in a second and a half on a lonely Saturday night in the winter of 1986. Its even more intricate successor, “L.A. Confidential”, also occurred to him “in a single rush”. Then comes the graft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With help from an assistant, Ellroy researches and then writes a detailed synopsis that’s often as long as the book itself. (Without it, he says he wouldn’t be able to “write a book worth a shit”.) Then he flies to New York to discuss the outline with his editors at Knopf, his American publisher. Finally, he says, “I execute at great length and revise in great detail.” A working day can begin as early as 1.45am. “I’ve got the outline typed up on the desk. I get up, say my prayers, have a cup of cold coffee I made the night before, get it in my system quicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy called his taste in language “very precise”. Small imperfections “leap out at me”. He avoids semi-colons and shifts indiscriminately to the present tense—“which drives copy editors crazy”. “If you want to be very good at this,” he said, “the road is consciousness. Am I repeating this motif? Is this plausible? Does this track logically? Are the paragraph breaks in the right place? Is this information exposited too early? When should this man meet this woman? That was the gradual electrifying revelation – if one has native talent of the level I possess, then it’s about consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy says of Knode that “There’s no one else for me but her.” They met in 1990 and they married a year later: “The aggregate of all the other women I’ve known don’t equal Helen in soul, gravity or native intellect.” The two share a tendency towards solitude and a strict morality. But whereas Ellroy failed to finish high school, Knode has a master’s from Cornell and worked for a magazine, LA Weekly, which sprang from the counterculture Ellroy detested. He is loping and saturnine, husky and housebound, with a tendency to bark, bay and growl; Knode is prone to gales of laughter and micro-bursts of surprise. She exudes an air of sensible busyness as she zips about the city in one of her many well-cut trench-coats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ellroy and Knode met he had recently entered a period of conscious self-restraint, even self-punishment. Editing “L.A. Confidential” he had turned against flourish, metaphor and scene-setting, developing a habit of “cutting words and cutting words” that resulted in a kind of staccato shorthand. He was also growing more isolated. His behaviour was characterised, Knode told me, by “churning, compulsion, unreachability, one crazy idea after another. This was a guy who never had a moment of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, as he was working on “American Tabloid”, Knode took action. She felt that he needed to confront the fact of his mother’s murder more directly. That Christmas she gave Ellroy a framed copy of a newspaper photograph that depicted him in the moments after he was told his mother had been killed. Soon afterwards a journalist in California, who had access to his mother’s police file, contacted him. Ellroy’s response—not the one Knode intended – was to attempt to solve the case, more than three decades on, and write up his findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My Dark Places”, a memoir that explored the immediate aftermath and longer legacy of his mother’s death, was published in 1996. Ellroy recognises that the book was, at best, a partial reckoning with his personal trauma. At home things carried on much as before. Ellroy has described his conduct as boorish, oblivious, callow, heedless, isolated, “preposterously male”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001 Ellroy suffered episodes of sleeplessness and hypochondria and, eventually, a nervous breakdown. He became addicted to sedatives and sleeping pills. When I asked Ellroy what might have averted the breakdown, he said, “A different mind, a different soul. It was everything I’d suppressed in my life.” He also blames “The Cold Six Thousand”, the bestselling middle chapter of the USA trilogy, which represents the furthest extreme of his impulse to cut. Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, says this book is his favourite Ellroy novel but also “the logical acme point. He doesn’t give us a break, ever. There’s an element of obsession-compulsion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;  &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20190601_BLP505.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190601_BLP505.jpg 200w,

Wayne rotates. Pete moves stateside. Laurent’s there. Ditto Flash. They funnel stateside. Stanton stays in-country. Ditto Mesplède. Tiger Kamp runs low-supervised. The war escalates. More troops pass through. The kadre hits Saigon half-assed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Knode, the novel reflected Ellroy’s frazzled state. She recalled thinking, “We don’t need any literary criticism here—we just need a doctor!” As things turned out, there were numerous doctors—and an actor. When Ellroy was in psychiatric lockdown, a friend put Knode in touch with Carrie Fisher. “She was a big help,” Knode says. “She knew everything. In the middle of James’s crack-up, she gave me a better picture of the modern medical landscapes and the gaps in its treatment than I’d had in two years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy said that Fisher died with drugs in her system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She never claimed to be clean, Big Dog,” Knode said. “She just claimed to know everything about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy kicked the drugs but continued to show signs of collapse. In “The Hilliker Curse” (2010), his second, more candid attempt to grapple with his mother’s legacy, he quotes a letter from Knode recalling that during this time he would drive his car too fast, dribble, wear shit-stained trousers, and audibly masturbate while her family was visiting. She got tired of waiting for him to change. Knode introduced the idea of an open marriage, but in the end it was Ellroy who met someone else—a left-wing academic named Joan. Ellroy and Knode divorced in April 2006. But they continued to talk on the phone almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy’s relationship with Joan was short­lived. After they separated, he moved to Los Angeles—the first time he had lived there in 25 years. “So, I’m alone—I’m gassing, I’m yearning.” He was looking southbound out of his window on Rossmore Avenue when he had another “synaptic flash: forlorn-looking Japanese, in wintertime, in a bus, going up a mountain road in a snowstorm to the Manzanar internment camp in the High Sierras. Immediately I knew: four novels, World War Two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Knode reunited in 2015 when he was promoting “Perfidia”, the first of his new LA Quartet. Knode was living in Denver, so Ellroy bought a flat down the hall. Knode lives more conventionally than him. Her apartment has a kitchen table, wallpaper and a comfortable-looking sofa. The art on the walls doesn’t all involve dogs or crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evening Ellroy and I had dinner at Knode’s place. It was Saturday night—fight night. Ellroy was excited about the boxing but also still distracted by the problems with “the fucking heat”. As we entered he turned to me. “Helen wants you to take off your shoes. I don’t go for that shit myself.” On a table in the hall was a copy of “This Storm” and a post-it note saying “Read me now”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knode and Ellroy watch boxing on two channels, Showtime and the Zone, which is run by Eddie Hearn, a boxing promoter. Knode said that Hearn had revolutionised their lives, but when the Zone stuttered on her Apple TV he was held responsible for ruining their evening. The refrain “Fuck Eddie Hearn” soon established itself. When he wasn’t yelling at the TV, Ellroy refused Knode’s offer of tea with the formula, “Fuck that shit.” He requested a cup of black coffee, and Knode frowned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I gots to have it, baby,” he said. “Just one cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not underwriting this,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know—it is late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knode told me that though Ellroy’s propensity to repeat certain jokes and riffs is unchanged, in other ways he’s grown up. He is able to “listen now in a way he wasn’t able to before. He’s burned out a lot of the bad shit.” She mentioned the dinners with Jerry Ackerman—regular meet-ups with a friend. He has a healthier relationship with the murder of Elizabeth Short. And after many years of living exclusively with his own books, he has started to read again. His current lifestyle, though oatmeal-heavy and pet-free, constitutes a loosening of the reins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he has been adding words. Like Ellroy’s earlier books, “This Storm” has short paragraphs, single-clause sentences and heightened, at times wearying repetition. Ellroy acknowledges that he still makes “purportedly clean and direct” writers such as Dashiell Hammett and Ernest Hemingway seem “absolutely florid”. But with help from Knode and his editors he is also now convinced that, if he wants the books to have “emotional resonance”, he needs to open things up, if only a little. He calls this “a new style”—“the perfect balance” of the precise and lyrical. It’s as if, over the last decade, he has realised the need to embrace, if not equally, the two sides of his nature—wildness and control, rectitude and romanticism, “emotionality” and a spotless sideboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my last morning in Denver, I visited Ellroy at his flat and Knode dropped by. She asked if we were getting tired of “talking about Ellroy”. He said that we were not. Reflecting on his current circumstances, Ellroy says that he’s feeling “just outrageous good will for people”, before admitting that “I can be short-tempered and I can be rancorous and all these things, if people are pushing up against me or taking liberties”—for example, when waiters use the greeting “Hi, guys.” Then he paused, searching around for words: “I’ve just never been this happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His new work reflects that. Without stinting on traditional Ellroy pleasures, it contains more hope and consolation. Fans of Ellroy’s earlier work may feel that he’s gone soft. Instead of evil or mercenary violence, and the “tableau of madness, hatefulness and historical dysfunction” constructed in “The Cold Six Thousand”, “This Storm” is concerned with “friendship, bravery, the ability of individuals of a wide stripe to supersede their differences and limitations and tell the truth to themselves.” Even the protagonist—“a monstrous psychopath, a fascist, a racial provocateur”—proves himself vulnerable and capable of fraternal love for a Japanese man. “This Storm” offers, says Ellroy, “the thrill of human beings changing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve taken a big breath and relaxed,” Knode told him. “It’s a lot more lucid, less internally tortured. I can just feel the oozing humanity in this one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellroy looked lovingly in her direction. “I’m honoured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should be,” she said. “You did the work.” Ellroy gave a growl of assent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leo Robson is a freelance journalist who has written for the &lt;/em&gt;New Yorker&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(永久域名，墙)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.co" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.co(临时域名)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 20:40:19 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A journalist’s arrest is a worrying sign of impunity in Russia]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/06/07/a-journalists-arrest-is-a-worrying-sign-of-impunity-in-russia]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190608_eup507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-06-07T04:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Jun 7th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE HEADLINES on Ivan Golunov’s articles make it clear that he may have made some enemies. One article pledges to explain “how officials, the security services, and bandits carve up the market for funeral services”. Others allege that the family of a vice-mayor “made billions and bought up mansions and apartments”, or promise to list “who’s making a killing on Moscow’s reconstruction”. As an investigative journalist for independent Russian media outlets, Mr Golunov developed a reputation for thorough shoe-leather reporting and scrupulous work with procurement databases to expose state corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of June 6th, Moscow police detained Mr Golunov in the city centre while he was walking to meet a source. The police claimed to have found a stash of drugs in his backpack, and released photos of a small drug lab supposedly discovered in his apartment. Mr Golunov has been booked on charges of selling narcotics, carrying a potential 10- to 20-year sentence. He was prevented from contacting anyone for more than 12 hours. After a sympathetic detective tipped off a friend of Mr Golunov’s, a lawyer arrived at last. Mr Golunov alleged that police had planted the drugs and beat him up. The police refused to let medical personnel document his wounds, though they deny any misbehaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Golunov’s editors at Meduza, an independent news site, believe his journalism is the reason for his arrest. “We know that Ivan has received threats in recent months, and we think we know from whom,” they wrote. Colleagues and friends describe Mr Golunov as a virtual teetotaller who obeyed the law scrupulously, to avoid giving the authorities excuses to harass him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the Russian reality, an investigative journalist even crosses the street with particular care: only on a green light, so there will be nothing to pin on him,” said Svetlana Reiter, a fellow investigative journalist. Meduza says that the handwriting on notes in police photographs does not appear to match Mr Golunov’s. Acquaintances told that site that they recognise only one of the photographs as his apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brazenness of the charges is not a glitch. Instead, it highlights the increasing impunity of the Russian security services. Police are known for planting drugs to meet arrest quotas. Until now such tactics have been used against political opponents only in Chechnya, where Oyub Titiev, a human-rights activist, was sentenced in March to four years in prison on drug charges that observers called fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Mr Titiev’s, Mr Golunov’s arrest is meant to send a message. “It’s a signal that they can do the same or worse with any of us,” said Pavel Kanygin of Novaya Gazeta, an independent newspaper. Journalists and supporters gathered on June 7th near the police headquarters for a series of one-man pickets, a tactic activists use to avoid a ban on protesting in groups without permission. Police detained at least seven of them—one by one—including Mr Kanygin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As police were hauling the protesters into police vans, President Vladimir Putin was striding on stage at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Russia’s yearly gathering of economic bigwigs. The atmosphere at this year’s forum has been marred by the arrest in February of Michael Calvey, a prominent American investor, on dubious fraud charges. Mr Putin touted Russia’s business climate and endorsed the investigation into Mr Calvey. “Just, legal decisions will be made,” Mr Putin insisted. The arrest of Mr Golunov suggests that in today’s Russia, lawlessness often masquerades as justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 04:40:42 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
