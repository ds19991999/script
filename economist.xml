The full text of the ERA, which was passed in a storm of controversy in the 1970s, seems unprovocative today: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex”. Yet a renewed push to ratify the amendment looks likely to spark fresh discord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ERA was first proposed by Alice Paul, a leader of the campaign for women’s suffrage, in 1923. With overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate—and support from President Richard Nixon—Congress passed the ERA in 1972. When the measure went to the states (the constitution says that three-fourths must ratify an amendment), its prospects looked good. Within five years, 35 of the required 38 states had signed up. Then nothing happened. The original seven-year deadline for ratification that Congress had placed in the preamble of the amendment was extended to 1982—and still, the remaining three states failed to ratify it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly a century after its introduction, campaigners think they are on the verge of a breakthrough. On March 27th, a group of 22 Senate Democrats, including six presidential hopefuls, reintroduced the ERA in the upper chamber. They have been encouraged by the fact that in 2017 and 2018 Nevada and Illinois became the 36th and 37th states to ratify. Campaigners across the country are taking bets on which state might be the next, and last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 13 states that have not ratified the amendment, many activists see Virginia as the ERA’s best hope. The amendment had previously passed the state Senate, but floundered in the House of Delegates, where it failed in committee again this January. When Democrats proposed a change to House rules to bring the resolution to the floor in February, the measure failed by one vote. Eleanor Smeal, a former president of the National Organisation for Women and a leader of the campaign to pass the ERA in the 1970s and 80s, says proponents of the amendment should not be disappointed. If Democrats win a majority of seats in Virginia’s House elections in November, Mrs Smeal says, they will have the votes. ERA campaigners cherish similar hopes in Arizona and North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the ERA can clear the 38-state hurdle, what will happen next? In a recent op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Senators Ben Cardin and Lisa Murkowski, a Democrat and a Republican, argued that the 1982 deadline was arbitrary, and that Congress “handcuffed itself” by including it in the amendment’s introduction. They have introduced a bill that would remove the deadline, theoretically clearing the way for ratification of the ERA upon passage by a final state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some states have come to regret their ratification. In the 1970s—thanks in large part to an anti-ERA campaign led by Phyllis Schlafly, a firebrand critic of feminism—five states voted to rescind their approval. It is not clear that states have the authority to rescind ratification of a pending amendment. The question made it to the Supreme Court in 1982 with &lt;em&gt;National Organisation for Women v Idaho&lt;/em&gt;, which concerned one of those five states, but as the 10-year deadline for ratification had just expired, the court dismissed the case as unsettled. How would today’s judiciary handle such squabbles? If campaigners call for the ERA’s adoption upon ratification by a 38th state, those five states may mount a legal challenge. “No one really knows how to handle that situation,” says David Strauss, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. “It’s all a great unknown and it’s not clear the Supreme Court would touch that”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question that looms largest over this latest push is whether America still needs the amendment at all. Around half of the states already have some version of the Equal Rights Amendment written into their constitutions. Women in the rest of the country may stand to benefit from a federal standard. However, the legal landscape changed significantly in recent decades. As a lawyer arguing in front of the Supreme Court in the 1970s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped broaden the scope of the 14th Amendment’s equal-protection clause to include discrimination on the basis of sex. Women can now attend what were once all-male military institutes and may not be struck from juries on the basis of their sex, for example. The ERA may not add much to this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist groups on both sides of the ERA debate see larger-stakes issues on the horizon. Many pro-life groups view the amendment as a pernicious attempt by the left to entrench more permissive abortion requirements in the constitution. They quote Jerrold Nadler, a congressman from New York, who in June 2018 pitched the ERA as a bulwark against the possible erosion of Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling recognising a woman’s right to access abortion in the first trimester. “What the Supreme Court giveth, the Supreme Court can taketh away”, he said. That is true. But there is little reason to believe that the ERA, by itself, would stand in for Roe and save abortion rights should the Supreme Court one day dispatch the long-standing precedent. There are, however, other reproductive-rights concerns for which the ERA may provide a constitutional hook in litigation. For example, some ask whether paying childbirth expenses under Medicaid obliges the government to provide funds for medically necessary abortions as well. Another concern involves access to contraceptive care under the Affordable Care Act, which the Supreme Court decided in &lt;em&gt;Burwell v Hobby Lobby&lt;/em&gt; could be denied to women by employers with religious objections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the legal implications, women’s rights activists and legal scholars seem to agree that ratifying the ERA would have symbolic and cultural value. Justice Ginsburg is sceptical that the amendment would make a huge difference to the lives of American women. But she has said that she “would like to be able to take out my pocket constitution and say that the equal citizenship stature of men and women is a fundamental tenet of our society, like free speech”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;获取更多RSS：&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank"&gt;https://feedx.net(此域名已被污染，谢谢大家一直以来的支持)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 03:07:27 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why do India’s elections take so long?]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/04/11/why-do-indias-elections-take-so-long]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_BLP506.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-11T17:05:09Z&quot;&gt;Apr 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALMOST ONE in eight of the world’s adult population is eligible to vote in the election for the next Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament. Something close to one-seventh of them were invited to vote today, April 11th. The rest of the nearly 900m people who may choose to exercise their franchise will wait their turn over the course of the next 37 days, in a series of six more phases. They are staggered, such that about six days pass between each round, and scattered all over the country, in a splotchy-looking map that the Election Commission of India has calibrated carefully. One effect is that no one will know who won any given seat—let alone whether the prime minister, Narendra Modi, keeps control of the government, or lets it slip to some unfathomable assembly of opposition parties—until May 23rd. That morning all the ballots are to be counted within just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why draw out the voting like this? The seven-phase calendar imposes practical difficulties of its own. There are strict rules that are supposed to prevent news of polling in any one area from affecting the voting decisions made in another. (Let’s never mind the bated breath of a billion-odd people waiting for an outcome.) But here is the catch: those same strictures, the “model code of conduct”, are what make the slow and steady pace necessary. The code is implemented by a roving company of administrators, backed up by an enormous number of police and paramilitary forces. Getting from one part of the country to another takes time; some of India’s 1m polling stations are still extremely remote. The whole state of Arunachal Pradesh, next to the border with Myanmar, voted today, which meant that 32 officials had to be airlifted into a deep forested valley. The Election Commission is nowadays most concerned with ensuring a fair and well publicised vote, but in wilder times it was also responsible for protecting ballot boxes from being stuffed or stolen, or candidates kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get our daily newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor&amp;#x27;s Picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; required=&quot;&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email address&quot;  aria-label=&quot;Subscription mail&quot;/&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Sign up now&quot; /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_WOM916.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190413_WOM916.png 200w,

Several of the states that went to the polls today managed their voting in one go: Arunachal in the north-east, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh around the south-central Deccan plateau, and Uttarakhand in the Himalayas north of Delhi. These are all relatively peaceful places (notwithstanding the odd Maoist attack in the south). By contrast the northern and eastern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, across the most densely populated and also the poorest belt of all, are broken up into seven parts each. They are also notorious for their rough-and-tumble politics, and the thuggery that comes with it. The Kashmir valley in the far north is not nearly so thick with people, but its security problems are even more intense; it is the other place to keep the commissioners busy through April and May.&lt;p&gt;The staggering is the one thing that has brought the Election Commission the least criticism. In this fevered season opposition parties, NGOs and other observers all see the tables being tilted against them. Every day brings a new complaint, and sometimes even redress. On April 10th the commission ruled that a hagiographical film biopic about Mr Modi cannot be released until after the election, and also that “NaMo TV”, a mysterious new satellite channel, must be counted as pro-Modi advertising. Such enforcement of the model code will continue through the election itself. On April 12th the Supreme Court is to decide whether “electoral bonds”, a new method of funnelling corporate donations anonymously into party coffers, should be voided midway through the voting. Lots of work left to do, only 37 days and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 02:06:21 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sudan ousts its dictator, how to get more kidney donors and Donald Trump as a pro wrestler]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2019/04/11/sudan-ousts-its-dictator-how-to-get-more-kidney-donors-and-donald-trump-as-a-pro-wrestler]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/editors_picks_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-11T16:37:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SELECTION of three essential articles read aloud from the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;The Economis&lt;/em&gt;t.

The event’s adopted slogan, “a tradition unlike any other”, is a fair claim. The Masters is by far the most popular event on the golfing calendar, drawing nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.statista.com/statistics/244272/golf-tournaments-viewership-us&quot;&gt;twice as large a television audience&lt;/a&gt; in the United States as its peers do. It is the most exclusive of the game’s marquee events, fielding around 90 players rather than the standard 156, though all former champions receive a permanent invitation to participate every year—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/apr/08/golf.masters20051&quot;&gt;no matter how old they are&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only one of the four majors played at the same venue every year: the Augusta National golf club, an institution so set in its ways it refused to admit women as members until 2012. And the garish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.golf-monthly.co.uk/tour/us-masters/masters-history-records/masters-green-jacket-126753&quot;&gt;green jacket&lt;/a&gt; presented to each Masters victor is seen as so precious that even the champion himself cannot keep it in his closet permanently. Instead, he can sport it only during the year of his reign. Afterwards, he must return it to Augusta National, and can wear it only when visiting the club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to most tournaments in individual sports, attention from fans and media focuses mainly on the top handful of players. Not so in 2019, when the lion’s share of golfing discussion has focused on a competitor who does not even figure among the top ten in the official world rankings. Of course, that golfer happens to be named Tiger Woods, who at his best was the greatest player the sport has ever seen. After losing nearly a decade to injuries and scandal, Mr Woods has mounted an impressive comeback during the past year. In September he won his first official event since 2013, and he was among the leaders on the final day of both of the past two major tournaments. Betting markets currently give him a healthy 5% chance of claiming his 15th major crown at Augusta this year, trailing only the top three on the official rankings (Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the public’s rediscovered affection for Mr Woods—now seen as a scrappy underdog rather than a reckless, entitled superstar—may be clouding the markets’ judgment. Since 2016 &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; has produced a statistical prediction model for men’s major golf tournaments called EAGLE (&lt;i&gt;Economist&lt;/i&gt; Advantage in Golf Likelihood Estimator). It calculates each player’s probability of winning an event based on his past performance; the configuration and scoring history of the course; and, once a tournament begins, all of the results recorded so far. In the past, EAGLE has only appeared as a projected leaderboard. This year, however, we are pleased to display all of its predictions on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://eagle.economist.com&quot;&gt;new, interactive data-visualisation site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure &gt;&lt;div &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_WOC924.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  srcSet=&quot;/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20190413_WOC924.png 200w,

As our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/06/our-masters-forecast-is-lukewarm-on-tiger-woods&quot;&gt;article in this week’s print edition &lt;/a&gt; shows, the current version of Mr Woods is not only a shadow of his former self, but is also inferior to many other modern golfers with far thinner résumés. For a 43-year-old, Mr Woods is performing exceedingly well: EAGLE predicts he would shoot around 0.4 strokes above par per 18 holes on a course of average difficulty for a major, ranking him among the world’s ten best players. Unfortunately, to win the Masters he will need to defeat several dozen competitors who are still in the prime of youth. EAGLE gives him a modest 2% probability of victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if not Mr Woods, who is most likely to don the green jacket? Mr Rose, who reached a sudden-death playoff at Augusta in 2017 but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.economist.com/game-theory/2017/04/10/how-bad-was-sergio-garcias-barren-run&quot;&gt;lost to Sergio García&lt;/a&gt;, currently sits atop the official world rankings. Betting markets see Mr McIlroy, who has finished among the top ten in all seven events he has played this year, as a clear favourite, with an 11% chance to win, nearly twice Mr Rose’s 6%. EAGLE also considers both of these stars to be leading candidates—but gives them around a 5% probability of victory, suggesting that Mr McIlroy is rather over-valued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is the 34-year-old Mr Johnson whom the model sees as the leading contender in the field. Both he and Mr McIlroy have been on top of their games at the start of 2019. But golf is a fickle sport: even with no change in underlying skill, players’ scores vary vastly from day to day, thanks to the vagaries of course conditions and the random chance inherent in propelling a ball so small over distances so long. As a result, it takes very large samples of data to yield reliable estimates of golfers’ ability. Whereas human handicappers tend to place a heavy emphasis on recent form and mostly ignore results more than a few months old, EAGLE takes the long view. It factors in scores from a full year ago at around two-fifths of the impact of current data, and even incorporates rounds two years in the past (albeit at just one-sixth of the weight of a scorecard submitted yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr McIlroy has proven he can win consistently on the biggest of stages, with four major titles before he turned 26. In contrast, questions still abound regarding the intestinal fortitude of the 34-year-old Mr Johnson, who has only one major championship to his name despite being five years older than Mr McIlroy. By design, however, EAGLE pays no heed to such arguments: with just four majors played per year, and so much good fortune required to beat such strong competition, there is no statistically reliable method to distinguish “clutch” or choke-prone golfers from those who are merely unlucky. (The model’s indifference to such criticisms was perhaps the main reason why it saw Mr García, who won his first major at the Masters at the age of 37, as one of the entrants most under-rated by betting markets entering the tournament.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, EAGLE disregards Mr McIlroy’s glittering trophy case, and focuses instead on his relative stumbles late last year—such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.rte.ie/sport/golf/2018/1026/1006791-mcilroy-finds-water-twice-at-the-same-hole-in-torrid-77&quot;&gt;second-round 77&lt;/a&gt; at the WGC-HSBC Champions in October. Although Mr Johnson is hardly immune to a bad round, his duds have simply been fewer and less disastrous than Mr McIlroy’s during the past year. Meanwhile, his finest moments have been even more impressive than his Northern Irish rival’s have. In February he shot 61 en route to winning the Saudi International, a showing that in EAGLE’s estimation was the third-best round of the past year (trailing only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.europeantour.com/challengetour/season=2018/tournamentid=2018762/news/newsid=357957.html&quot;&gt;60 by Matt Ford&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2018/tournamentid=2018078/news/newsid=357890.html&quot;&gt;59 by Oliver Fisher&lt;/a&gt; that set a European Tour record). Under typical conditions for a major, EAGLE predicts Mr Johnson to come in 0.3 strokes below par per round. With Mr McIlroy (and Mr Rose) both forecasted at just about even par, that edge translates into an 8% chance of victory for the occasionally star-crossed Mr Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in any golf tournament with a large field, however, if you are asked which of the favourites is likely to win, the correct answer is “none of the above”. Over a mere 72 holes, a few strokes of good luck—literally and figuratively—count for far more than a substantive difference in skill. In the past 12 majors, just two of the victors were among the top five in the official rankings at the times when they won. If history and statistics are any guide, whoever gets to pick the menu at the Masters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttp://www.augusta.com/masters/story/news/2019-04-08/patrick-reed-serving-his-favorites-champions-dinner&quot;&gt;champions’ dinner&lt;/a&gt; next year will probably be a player only keen golf fans have heard of—but who has already demonstrated enough skill to compete with the world’s best if everything breaks his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EAGLE’s favourite player in this tier is Patrick Cantlay. Once a highly touted amateur, Mr Cantlay’s career was derailed for three years by back injuries. Save for one event that seems to bring out the best in him—the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, which he won in 2017 and finished second in the following year—he has rarely challenged for victories. However, his overall scoring record is close to elite: by EAGLE’s reckoning, his average card during the past year has been better than those of Bryson DeChambeau and Francesco Molinari, currently ranked sixth and seventh in the world. The model gives Mr Cantlay just over a 2% chance of securing the green jacket, more than double the 1% chance bettors assign to him. It is of course possible that Mr Cantlay just does not have what it takes to win the big one. But the odds that he does are surely greater than one in 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a tournament gets underway, everyone is a long shot. By EAGLE’s assessment, even Mr Woods at the height of his powers had a 75% chance of losing each major he entered. Once golfers start registering scores, however, the odds start to fluctuate—modestly in the early rounds, violently on Sunday afternoon. When numerous players of varying abilities are bunched together on the leaderboard, even the savviest fan would struggle to determine just how close each of them is to securing the green jacket.

The affectionate name has been given to what at first appears to be a giant loom from the Industrial Revolution. And in some ways it is. Bertha (pictured above) is an automated braiding machine. Like a horizontal maypole, ribbons of carbon fibre are drawn from 288 bobbins contained on a pair of huge rings, and passed over and under one another as they are wound tightly around a revolving mould. The final product could be a propeller for an aeroplane, a ship’s hydrofoil or a set of wheels for a sports car. In fact, Bertha can knit just about any hollow component up to 800mm by ten metres, and do so quickly and accurately by depositing some 300kg of carbon fibre an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as textile production began to be mechanised at the end of the 18th century, creating the modern factory, manufacturing is going through another revolution. This time it is driven by digital processes and new materials, such as carbon-fibre composites. Automated braiders are one of several new systems turning carbon-fibre production from a slow, labour-intensive craft into a mass-manufacturing process that will change many industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon fibre is attractive because it is lightweight and exceptionally strong. The toughest fibres are up to ten times stronger than steel and eight times more so than aluminium, reckons Zoltek, an American carbon-fibre producer. Carbon fibre is also five times lighter than steel and half the weight, or less, of aluminium. Nor does it corrode. In transport industries, where “lightweighting” is most valuable, carbon fibre allows aircraft and cars to be made lighter and so travel farther on the same amount of fuel or a single charge of their batteries. This will help them meet tougher emissions targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are other advantages, too. One is that carbon fibre allows manufacturers to make much larger, more complex parts in one go, says Richard Oldfield, chief executive of the National Composites Centre (&lt;small&gt;NCC&lt;/small&gt;), a research laboratory set up by the University of Bristol, and home to Bertha. Instead of making an aircraft’s wing or car body by welding, riveting and bolting together hundreds of individual components, these bits can be consolidated into a single carbon-fibre structure. This saves time and materials and allows designers to come up with novel products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 &gt;Hot stuff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers got interested in carbon fibre in the 1960s. The fibres consist of carbonised polymers, made up of long strings of molecules bound together by the powerful bonds between carbon atoms. The fibres are made by heating a precursor material to around 3,000°C in a protective atmosphere of inert gases. The most commonly used precursor is polyacrylonitrile (&lt;small&gt;PAN&lt;/small&gt;), which is produced by the petrochemicals industry. Pitch, obtained from coal tar, is sometimes used instead. Once carbonised, the fibres are wound onto bobbins, spun into yarns or formed into tapes. Depending on the final application, they can also be woven into fabric sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their own, carbon fibres are brittle and can break easily. But their strength comes in tension (they resist being pulled apart). So, the fibres need to be aligned in such a way to impart their strength by distributing loads throughout a structure. This is done by placing the fibres, tapes or mats onto a mould in the required orientation, creating what is known as a preform. It is a slow process often done by hand. This is now being automated, aided by the fact that the optimal alignment of the fibres is often calculated using sophisticated computer-aided design systems, and the same data can program robots to lay-up the fibres or wind them on braiding machines such as Bertha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preforms then need to be made solid. This is done by impregnating the fibres with a chemically activated resin, which hardens when it is cured. The curing process is usually carried out inside a large oven called an autoclave, which applies heat and pressure to consolidate the structure and force out any air bubbles. It can take hours, sometimes with autoclaves left to run overnight. For a relatively low throughput this might not be a problem. But for higher volumes, especially in carmaking, faster cycle times are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various out-of-autoclave curing techniques are starting to be used. One is resin transfer moulding (&lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt;). This involves placing preforms inside a mould which is then closed. Resin is injected into the mould and heat and pressure applied. Depending on what is being produced, &lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt; can cut processing times by half or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 &gt;Fast cars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLaren has been making sports cars out of carbon fibre since the British company used the material for the world’s first Formula 1 racing car in 1981. All &lt;small&gt;F1&lt;/small&gt; cars are now made from carbon fibre, and the protection it affords drivers has allowed many to walk away from spectacular crashes. To build its sports cars the company starts with a carbon-fibre “MonoCell”, a giant tub which forms the main structure of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company uses a specialist contractor to make MonoCells, although those for future car models will be produced at a new £50m ($65m) McLaren Composites Technology Centre in Sheffield, Britain. The first of the new cells has just been delivered. Impressively, the large and complicated structures are produced with &lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt; in one go—although McLaren is keeping the details secret. “I often look at the MonoCell and wonder myself how it is possible to make it,” says Claudio Santoni, the centre’s technical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLaren says carbon fibre will be essential in keeping weight down in future hybrid and electric models. By 2025 it expects the centre to be making MonoCells for some 6,000 cars a year. As a high-end brand, it is not seeking large volumes. But other carmakers are. One is &lt;small&gt;BMW&lt;/small&gt;, which uses a variant of &lt;small&gt;RTM&lt;/small&gt; in Leipzig, Germany, to make bodies for more than 130 of its i3 electric cars every day. &lt;small&gt;BMW&lt;/small&gt; plans to increase that number substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another speedy production process is “overmoulding”. This combines sheets of carbon fibre with injection-moulded plastic. Injection moulding has long been used to produce plastic parts by extruding a molten polymer into a mould. It is quick and accurate. By combining the two processes, overmoulding allows plastic parts to be selectively reinforced with carbon fibre. Thus strengthened, such parts could be used as car doors, aircraft interiors and in many other products. The &lt;small&gt;NCC&lt;/small&gt; reckons an overmoulding system it is working with in Bristol can churn out finished components in just 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress is also being made in reducing the cost of carbon fibre itself. Prices vary according to quality, but industrial-grade carbon fibre is roughly $20 a kilogram, although aerospace versions are more expensive. By comparison, steel used in carmaking is about $1 a kilogram. As carbon fibre is so much lighter and stronger than steel, less material is needed. And the additional cost is also compensated for by product-lifetime savings on fuel and emissions. Nevertheless, cheaper carbon fibre would find greater use in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee thinks it could cut the cost of industrial-grade carbon fibre by about half with more efficient production processes. According to some estimates, roughly 90% of the energy needed to make things with carbon composites is consumed in producing the fibre itself. Oak Ridge is looking at the use of cheaper alternatives to &lt;small&gt;PAN&lt;/small&gt; and low-temperature carbonisation processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab also uses chopped-up carbon fibre in large-scale &lt;small&gt;3D&lt;/small&gt; printers to produce structures. It recently employed the system to print moulds for the precast concrete façade of the Domino tower, a new 42-storey building in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chopped carbon fibres can be made from manufacturing offcuts or recycled material. Recycling will become even more important once a greater number of carbon-fibre cars, aircraft, ships, wind turbines and other products reach the end of their working lives. There will be mountains of the black stuff to deal with. Companies are coming up with ways to recover the fibres, usually with heat or chemicals. Sometimes the fibres can be re-spun, but if they are too short they can still be suitable for parts subject to less stress. A combination of lower-cost mass-production techniques and effective carbon-fibre recycling, will lead to a lot more Berthas knitting away furiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Science and technology&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;How to knit a sports car&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:06:44 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The virtuosity of Mdou Moctar, the “Jimi Hendrix of the Desert”]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/04/11/the-virtuosity-of-mdou-moctar-the-jimi-hendrix-of-the-desert]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_BKP505.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-11T14:10:45Z&quot;&gt;Apr 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GROWING UP in Niger, Mdou Moctar listened to traditional Tuareg music. Women played the &lt;em&gt;imzad&lt;/em&gt;, a one-stringed fiddle, and the goatskin &lt;em&gt;tindé&lt;/em&gt; drum, while men trilled on the shepherd’s flute. &lt;em&gt;Takamba&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;assouf&lt;/em&gt;, guitar-driven styles, were his favourite. “I wanted to play guitar, but couldn’t find one where I lived,” Mr Moctar says via email. “I made one by hand out of wood and bicycle cables.” He practised diligently even though, at the time, music was a creative hobby rather than a plausible career. “When I was young I wanted to become an engineer who digs wells,” Mr Moctar says. “We always need water in the desert.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1986, he was still young when the “desert blues” genre—a reference to the shared roots of the music of the Mississippi Delta and the West African desert—emerged. Ali Farka Touré entranced listeners with his superposition of different melodies on the guitar; in 1994 he won a Grammy for “Talking Timbuktu”, a collaboration with Ry Cooder, an American musician. Tinariwen, a collective from Mali formed in 1979, worked with traditional instruments in the &lt;em&gt;assouf&lt;/em&gt; style, but added electrified sounds, pop influences and politicised lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Moctar honed his craft performing at local weddings, and word got around that a young, left-handed guitar player was a rising star. He recorded an album, “Anar”, in Nigeria in 2008, combining droning guitars with drum-machine beats and the auto-tuned vocals favoured by Nigerian pop at the time. His lyrics, sung in his native Tamashek, were poetic and referred to the themes of heartbreak and melancholy typical of &lt;em&gt;assouf&lt;/em&gt;: “My dream is to turn into a small bird to fly to her and kiss her between the eyebrows,” he sings on the title track (“anar” means “eyebrows”). The songs, traded via SIM cards, were hits. Christopher Kirkley, an American music writer, included them in his mixtape “Music from Saharan Cellphones”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Mr Moctar released “Afelan”, an album of field recordings from the open-air concerts he played in his home village. It combined heartfelt, melodic songs, such as “Tahoultine” (which explored the perils of beauty), and frenetic guitar work, evident on “Issuahid Elwanme”. It displayed the two sides of his artistry, one bold and colourful and the other intimate and reverent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well established at home, with Mr Kirkley’s help Mr Moctar gain international exposure in 2015 with “Akounak Tedalat Taha Tazoughai” (“Rain the Colour of Blue with a Little Red In It”), an adaptation of the film “Purple Rain”. Mr Moctar took on the role formerly inhabited by Prince, and he exhibits the same rebellious charisma as he rides his motorcycle through the desert of Agadez, guitar slung over his shoulder. The film and the soundtrack were praised on the film-festival circuit, positioning Mr Moctar as the next ambassador of Tuareg music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though “Sousoume Tamachek” (2017), an EP on which he played every instrument, and “Blue Stage Session” (2019), a collection of live recordings, have highlighted Mr Moctar’s exceptional skill, it is “Ilana (The Creator)”, a new album released on March 29th, which shows his mastery of his craft. Recorded in a studio in Detroit and then finished in Niger, the band of experienced African musicians (and an American bassist) improvise in most songs. They layer elements of Western rock over the hypnotic, repeating rhythms of desert blues. “Takamba”, an instrumental track, combines funk-like grooves with psychedelic guitar phrases reminiscent of the 1960s; “Ilana” makes use of brilliant and dense fingerpicking as well as the power chords favoured in hard rock. With “Inizgam” Mr Moctar steps out of the desert mode entirely and toys with British blues-rock stylings reminiscent of Cream. The effect is both disorienting and ecstatic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Moctar says he knows little about the classic rock canon: “I don&amp;#x27;t even know what rock is,” he maintains, “I just play what I sense and I understand”. He has picked up techniques and tricks, though. He began tapping—playing strings percussively on the fretboard—after watching videos of Eddie van Halen on YouTube (it is evident on “Tarhatazed”, the album’s centrepiece). He has professed a love for ZZ Top’s boogie rock. Mr Moctar plays a left-handed Fender guitar as did Jimi Hendrix, inviting a comparison of the two. Like Hendrix, he employs an unconventional and fearsome array of techniques as dreamlike passages give way to blazing and virtuosic solos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to “Ilana” is an exhilarating experience, yet Mr Moctar is a thoughtful frontman. He says the album is about injustice and “suffering in the desert”, though the frenetic sounds occasionally overpower the lyrics. “In the song ‘Ilana’ I send a prayer to the creator for help for our women and children who are suffering,” he writes of the title track, which critiques French uranium mining; elsewhere, he muses about his displaced people and the exploitation of women’s labour. True to his roots, he makes room for some traditional love songs, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:06:42 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Airbus risks losing its competitive thrust]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2019/04/11/airbus-risks-losing-its-competitive-thrust]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_WBD000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-11T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO AIRCRAFT BETTER sums up the quaint absurdity of Airbus’s origins than the Beluga. The cargo jet, which resembles a winged whale, carries aerofoils, tails and bits of fuselage from production sites across Europe to be turned into aeroplanes in Toulouse and Hamburg. In a normal company, it would be redundant. Like the Beluga, Airbus is far from normal. Started in 1967 as a jumble of aerospace firms from Germany, France, Britain and, later, Spain, it needs the ungainly plane to make it function smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of Europe’s biggest industrial firms, though, Airbus is neither quaint nor absurd. It has stood out for its innovation, competitiveness and, sometimes, inspired leadership. Under Tom Enders, an outspoken former German paratrooper, it has achieved its mission of becoming (Beluga notwithstanding) a more “normal” company. Mr Enders managed to reduce the influence and ownership of the French and German states. Airbus’s share price quadrupled in his seven-year tenure. Its American former head of sales, John Leahy, who retired last year, was a salesman extraordinaire, racking up, he claims, $1.6trn of aircraft sales at Airbus, making him the nemesis of its arch-rival, Boeing. With such men, it was harder to argue that the aerospace industry was a lazy duopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the past year Airbus has acquired a controlling stake in the C Series jet, designed by Bombardier of Canada, while Boeing has joined forces with Embraer, Bombardier’s Brazilian rival, making the fortress in single-aisle commercial-aircraft manufacturing even more impregnable. Meanwhile, Boeing is in disarray following two air disasters since last October that have grounded its bestselling jet. On the face of it, both developments are good for Airbus. In fact they could be the biggest potential traps for Guillaume Faury, the 51-year-old Frenchman who replaced Mr Enders on April 10th, because they risk dulling Airbus’s competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an operational point of view, Mr Faury takes over at an ideal time. Like everyone at Airbus, he will lament the crashes of Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft in Ethiopia and Indonesia, which killed 346 people. Undeniably, though, the longer that plane is grounded, the stronger the outlook for Airbus’s own highly successful narrow-body, the A320neo. Airbus may already be reaping the benefits: a bumper deal for 290 A320s from China last month was a further kick in the teeth for Boeing. In February Airbus took the tough decision to scrap its loss-making A380 super-jumbo. That will bolster margins on commercial aircraft, which hit 9% last year, according to Bloomberg—short of Boeing’s 13% but an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the curiosities of the Airbus-Boeing duopoly is how restrained those margins were—especially at Airbus. In his recent book about the global jetliner business, “AeroDynamic”, Kevin Michaels, an aerospace analyst, notes that between 2011 and 2017 both firms delivered more than 6,600 A320s and 737s between them. Normally, a duopoly and sky-high barriers to entry would have allowed them to jack up prices. Instead, they offered big discounts. The competition for orders was cut-throat, partly owing to the “John Leahy factor”, Mr Michaels writes.&lt;br/&gt;As operating margins at both firms have crept up recently, however, both have reduced the share of sales they spend on research and development of commercial aircraft. This is partly because the experience of building complex and costly new planes, such as Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’s A380, has been chastening. Such “moonshots” have gone out of fashion. Excessive re-engineering also played a part. Boeing’s 737 series dates back to 1967, the same year Airbus was conceived, and has been tinkered with extensively. As Boeing grapples with the two disasters, the prospect of deciding swiftly to build a new mid-sized aircraft, known as NMA, is receding. That takes more pressure off Airbus to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Airbus’s shareholders are clamouring for it to follow Boeing in handing back more cash through dividends and buy-backs. That is common across the capital markets. But it would make both companies keener than ever to milk their duopoly status. Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group, a consultancy, describes Boeing dismissively as a “legacy jet manufacturer and distributor of shareholder returns”. Its rising payouts may be one reason Boeing’s shares have not fallen more steeply, despite the firm’s admission this month that its software contributed to the crashes. Airbus will be tempted to move in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European firm would be wise to resist this urge and instead consider ploughing money back into the business. For a start, Mr Faury must contend with Brexit, which risks disrupting Airbus supply chains in Europe but may provide an opportunity to expand its operations beyond the continent. Then there is the long-running stand-off with Boeing over subsidies and tax breaks. On April 8th the Trump administration threatened tariffs on $11bn worth of European goods, including aircraft and helicopters, which would hurt Airbus. The European Union immediately threatened retaliation. Nothing will be decided until the World Trade Organisation sets the level of damages this summer. But one thing is clear: it will be harder for either firm to rely on state support in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A change in the climate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, Mr Faury has a chance to take advantage of a coming wave of technological change. Acknowledging this, he talks of innovation over the next decade and beyond that could match anything in the history of aviation. That includes engine electrification, artificial intelligence and advanced connectivity that would change how aircraft are developed, manufactured, flown, powered and serviced. It means increased use of new materials (see Science section) and 3D printing, and greater efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Airbus may be slow to embrace these long-term opportunities, given its cosy position. Gingerliness may even bring short-term gains. But technology could lower barriers to entry. In the end, ambition will pay off—even if it endangers the Beluga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 21:06:36 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Britain unveils a plan to regulate online content]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/04/11/britain-unveils-a-plan-to-regulate-online-content]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20190413_BRD001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-11T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 11th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;N THE SPRING&lt;/small&gt; a government’s fancy turns to thoughts of internet regulation. This month alone, Singapore announced a bill to clamp down on fake news, Taiwan said it would ban Chinese-owned video-streaming services and Australia rushed through its parliament a Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material bill, which among other things seeks to hold tech-company executives personally liable for failing swiftly to take down offensive content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 8th the British government published a 102-page policy paper outlining how it thinks internet regulation should work to reduce what it awkwardly calls “online harms”. It is enormous in scope and hugely ambitious, encompassing any company that allows people “to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online”. That would include not just big social networks but also community forums, review sites, dating apps and much else. The harms covered are similarly extensive, from terrorist material and child abuse to more subjective things such as trolling and disinformation. Some fear it opens the door to censorship of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there is a lot to iron out. The government appears keen to avoid stifling speech, imposing cumbersome regulation on small companies, snooping on private conversations or setting up large-scale monitoring of online traffic. But the paper is vague on how it will achieve its aims of proportionate regulation and monitoring without infringing on liberties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderating content on the internet has so far been a losing game of whack-a-mole. This was brought home by the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand in March, when a video of the shooting and a manifesto written by the alleged culprit spread rapidly on some of the world’s best-resourced social-media platforms despite efforts to prevent their dissemination. In the case of both copyright and terrorist- or abuse-related material, tech platforms are legally responsible for quickly removing content they find or are made aware of. Yet merely taking down objectionable content ignores the question of how it got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain’s approach—which it hopes will be adopted elsewhere—is to require companies to design their services in ways that make it harder for bad content to spread in the first place. The big idea is to impose a statutory “duty of care”. Companies must “take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services”. The government will set up a new regulator or hand new responsibilities to an existing one, such as Ofcom, which oversees broadcast media and telecoms, or the Information Commissioner’s Office, the data-protection watchdog. The regulator’s mandate will be broad: publishing guidelines for companies, overseeing complaints, encouraging co-operation between firms and issuing fines, as well as other, harsher penalties, including blocking websites in Britain or holding senior managers personally responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eventual legislation will have to walk a tightrope between several conflicting imperatives. Maintaining national security and protecting the vulnerable must be balanced against individual liberties. Imposing substantial requirements on big tech companies must not stifle innovation or prevent smaller firms from thriving. And the new law must not conflict with existing British and European rules that protect online platforms from liability for content they simply host. On the last, the government’s plans seem to suggest that, so long as companies live up to their duty of care by designing products in a way that discourages the dissemination of proscribed material, they will be protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech firms said they would work with ministers to fine-tune the regulations. They are already resigned to being kept on a tighter leash. Last month Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, called for more internet regulation in an article in the &lt;em &gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. Draft legislation will appear at the earliest in the autumn, and is unlikely to become law for a couple of years. A change of prime minister, a general election or continued parliamentary gridlock around Brexit could see it slip down the agenda. As the policy paper puts it, the government will “bring forward legislation when parliamentary time allows”. In the meanwhile, the harms continue to multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Britain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;First, do no harms&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:06:55 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The independence of central banks is under threat from politics]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/13/the-independence-of-central-banks-is-under-threat-from-politics]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190413_LDD001_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-13T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 13th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;RITICS OF ECONOMICS&lt;/small&gt; like to say that its abstract theories lack real-world pay-offs. There is a glaring counter-example: the global rise of central-bank independence in the past 25 years. In the 1970s it was normal for politicians to manipulate interest rates to boost their own popularity. That led to a plague of inflation. And so rich countries and many poorer ones shifted to a system in which politicians set a broad goal—steady prices—and left independent central bankers to realise it. In a single generation billions of people around the world have grown used to low and stable inflation and to the idea that the interest rates on their bank deposits and mortgages are under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today this success is threatened by a confluence of populism, nationalism and economic forces that are making monetary policy political again. President Donald Trump has demanded that interest rates should be slashed, speculated about firing the boss of the Federal Reserve and said he will nominate Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, two unqualified cronies, to its board. Brexiteers rubbish the competence and motives of the Bank of England, while in Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in a tug-of-war with the central bank. India’s government has replaced a capable central-bank chief with a pliant insider who has cut rates ahead of an election. And as we report this week, many top jobs at the European Central Bank (&lt;small&gt;ECB&lt;/small&gt;), including the presidency, are up for grabs, and some could become part of a wider political struggle over who runs Europe’s institutions (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/node/21762815&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;). There is a genuine need for reflection on central banks’ objectives and tools. But dangerous forces are afoot that could have alarming consequences for economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of politicisation last became acute in the 1970s. After the post-war Bretton Woods currency system collapsed, central banks failed to tame racing inflation because politicians, who pulled the strings, were reluctant to bear the short-term cost of higher unemployment. Two decades of runaway prices and crises led to a new orthodoxy that central banks should be given operational autonomy to pursue an inflation target. In the euro zone, Japan and Britain central banks became legally independent in the 1990s. In America the White House refrained from even publicly discussing Fed policy (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/node/21762785&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Free exchange&lt;/a&gt;). This consensus survived the crash of 2007-08 and is one reason why global inflation has been only 4% a year on average over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraying of central banks’ independence has several causes. One is populism. Leaders like Mr Trump combine the politician’s desire for low interest rates with a reckless urge to undermine institutions. Another is the scope of central banks’ activities, which expanded after the financial crisis. Most now hold huge portfolios of government bonds while, at the same time policing the financial industry. And the record of central banks is far from perfect. Because they have probably been too hawkish (despite their unconventional policies) the recovery from the crisis has been slow, undermining voters’ faith in the technocrats whose loyalty is supposedly to the public interest. All this makes it easier to view them as political. Meanwhile, the memory of the crises that led to independence has faded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure is manifesting itself in different ways in different places. Mr Trump has launched an attack on the Fed. Although his legal authority to sack Jerome Powell, its chairman and a Trump appointee, is not clear, if he wins re-election in 2020 he will be able to nominate a new Fed chairman and two more governors. In Europe a flurry of job changes threatens to lower the calibre of decision-making at the &lt;small&gt;ECB&lt;/small&gt; and feed underlying disagreements. By the end of the year, three members of the six-strong executive board and eight of the 19 national governors, who also vote on rates, will have left. The most notable of these is Mario Draghi, its head. His departure in October will happen almost concurrently with elections and a change in leadership at the European Commission and Council, a once-in-40-years overlap. Behind the political game of revolving chairs is a battle between countries to control policy. Northern Europeans have been suspicious of the &lt;small&gt;ECB&lt;/small&gt;’s bond-buying, seeing it as cover for subsidising southern Europe. Rather than win by force of argument, they are seeking an edge by getting their own people into the top jobs. That will store up problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps global inflation will rise again from its grave, in which case weaker central banks may struggle to kill it off. More likely is an economic downturn. The world economy has decelerated this year—on April 9th the &lt;small&gt;IMF&lt;/small&gt; downgraded its forecasts. Central banks may find themselves needing to pep up their economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what makes today’s politicisation so dangerous. Technocrats face a difficult challenge. The rich world has hardly any room to cut interest rates before hitting zero, so central banks will once again have to turn to unconventional stimulus, such as bond-buying. The Fed and other central banks may also need to co-operate globally, as in the wake of the crisis. The &lt;small&gt;ECB&lt;/small&gt; will have to convince markets that it will do whatever it takes to contain another financial panic on Europe’s periphery. The presence of political appointees, who are either ill-qualified or northern European hawks, would make all these tasks harder. It is not just that their votes count, but also that they would poison the public debate about what central banks should and should not do to deal with recessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 &gt;The talking cure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is right that the objectives and tools of monetary policy are subject to democratic scrutiny and that central bankers are accountable to legislatures. The Fed is reviewing its target in order to be prepared for a downturn. Other central banks should follow suit. In the long run, this secures their legitimacy and hence their independence. Yet in today’s political environment it is naive to think that politicians really want a considered debate. Instead, the more central banks are in the limelight, the more they will find their month-to-month decision-making subject to external pressure, or find themselves at the whim of boards packed with hacks. It is just that sort of politicisation that the theorists behind independent central banks wanted to avoid. Look back 40 years and you will get a flavour of what could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Leaders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;Interference Day&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:05:58 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How not to weaken central banks’ independence]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/04/13/how-not-to-weaken-central-banks-independence]]></link><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190413_FND000_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;time  itemProp=&quot;dateCreated&quot; dateTime=&quot;2019-04-13T00:00:00Z&quot;&gt;Apr 13th 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  itemProp=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HERE ARE&lt;/small&gt; more than a few echoes of the Nixon era in the presidency of Donald Trump. Monetary reverberations are among them. Facing re-election in 1972, Richard Nixon felt he needed a strong economy at his back, and made a habit of haranguing Arthur Burns, the chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time. Burns recounted the meetings in his diaries: “The president looked wild; talked like a desperate man; fulminated with hatred against the press; took some of us to task…” Historians reckon Burns was too accommodating of Nixon’s demands, and so helped launch the inflation of the 1970s. Mr Trump is now waging his own assault on the Fed’s independence. He has repeatedly complained about the central bank’s decisions and urged it to take a more doveish stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly Mr Trump, who has already chosen three of the five sitting members of the Fed’s board of governors, has named Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to fill the remaining two vacancies. In contrast to candidates who have come before, both are political activists. But the parallel with the 1970s is less apt than it seems. There are different ways to politicise monetary policy, and Mr Trump’s is particularly poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nixon’s inflation helped inform modern ideas of central-bank independence. In 1977 Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott, who won the Nobel prize together in 2004, published a seminal paper on the problem of “time inconsistency”. Governments can promise to keep inflation low, they argued, but that promise becomes harder to keep as time goes on. Once the public expects low inflation, there are political advantages to generating a burst of higher-than-anticipated price growth, which reduces the real (inflation-adjusted) value of debt and generates a short-run increase in real incomes and output. As governments succumb to the temptation to inflate, expectations adjust and the inflation rate needed to surprise the public rises ever higher. In the absence of a mechanism to keep inflation low, prices accelerate. Along with policy rules and inflation targets, central-bank independence became one of the ways governments’ promise not to inflate were made credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even as independence became more common, it remained incomplete. Governments are often responsible for setting central banks’ mandates, appointing their heads and determining what tools they can use to do their jobs. Many elected leaders have succumbed to the temptation to jawbone monetary policymakers. In the months before the election of 1992, George H.W. Bush urged Alan Greenspan to cut interest rates; he later blamed the Fed for his loss at the polls. In his memoirs Paul Volcker recalls an awkward meeting with Ronald Reagan and his chief of staff, James Baker, in which he was ordered not to raise rates in the run-up to the election of 1984. During the financial crisis, central banks around the world came under fire from politicians for having allowed financial excess to build up, bailing out banks during the crisis and using unconventional measures to support damaged economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These political intrusions did not prevent central banks from keeping inflation low. On the contrary, economists are increasingly asking whether stubbornly low rates of inflation, interest and growth show that the need for independence was overstated. Inflation was high around the world in the 1970s. Perhaps rather than a weak-willed Fed chairman being to blame, the problem lay in factors specific to that period, or a flawed understanding of the relationship between monetary policy and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with today’s chronically low interest rates, central banks may need to revise their policy frameworks to stop economies falling into slumps. But without a shove from politicians, they may be too institutionally conservative to do so. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, won election in 2012 on a promise to rejuvenate the economy, and immediately pressed the Bank of Japan to be more zealous. The result has been an impressive run of growth rather than a macroeconomic disaster. Structurally low interest rates also mean that central banks need more help from fiscal policymakers when demand slackens. That co-operation will inevitably weaken central banks’ institutional independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 &gt;The fool’s mandate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might one argue, then, that by pressing the Fed to aid his re-election campaign Mr Trump is undercutting a norm that has outlived its usefulness—even, that he could be helping America claw its way out of the low-rate trap that has ensnared most of the rich world? In fact, the selection of Mr Moore and Mr Cain suggests a very different sort of politicisation is at work. Neither is a professional economist; both have worked extensively in Republican politics. Mr Moore advised Mr Cain during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in the election of 2012, which was derailed after a promising start by allegations of sexual harassment. Both have expressed monetary-policy positions that might mark them out as hawks. In 2008, when the American economy was on the brink of a deep recession, Mr Moore said that the Fed should be raising rates rather than cutting them, and predicted high inflation to come. Mr Cain has said he favours a return to the gold standard. But politics, rather than data or principles, appears to guide their views. Mr Moore now joins the president in complaining that the Fed is holding back growth unnecessarily. Mr Cain has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that statistical agencies faked economic data in an effort to boost the fortunes of Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, if appointed, the pair would surprise Mr Trump and vote as his prior picks have, in an orthodox fashion. If they behave instead as party loyalists, the greatest risk is not that an ineffectual Fed will allow inflation like that of the 1970s to take hold. The opposite might well result if the pair revert to hawkishness when power changes hands. The danger is rather that the Fed will become a political weapon, and that America will move closer to becoming a nation where the welfare of the ruling party trumps that of the country as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer itemProp=&quot;publication&quot; &gt;This article appeared in the&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span itemProp=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;Finance and economics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt;section of the print edition under the headline&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;Monetary targets&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:05:56 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
